"When it &nbsp;pleased God &nbsp;to raise &nbsp;up kings &nbsp;and emperors &nbsp;favouring sincerely<br>
the Christian &nbsp;truth, &nbsp;that&nbsp; which &nbsp;the Church&nbsp; before either could not or<br>
durst &nbsp;not do, &nbsp;was &nbsp;with all &nbsp;alacrity performed. &nbsp;Temples were in<br>
all &nbsp;places &nbsp;erected, &nbsp;no &nbsp;cost &nbsp;was &nbsp;spared: &nbsp;nothing judged too<br>
dear which that way should be spent. The whole world did<br>
seem &nbsp;to exult, &nbsp;that it had occasion &nbsp;of pouring &nbsp;out gifts<br>
to so blessed a purpose. That cheerful devotion which<br>
David did this way &nbsp;exceedingly delight to behold,<br>
and wish &nbsp;that the &nbsp;same &nbsp;in the &nbsp;Jewish people<br>
might be perpetual, was then in Christian<br>
people &nbsp;&nbsp;every &nbsp;&nbsp;where &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to &nbsp;&nbsp;be &nbsp;&nbsp;seen.<br>
So far &nbsp;as our &nbsp;Churches and their<br>
Temple &nbsp;have &nbsp;one end, &nbsp;what<br>
should &nbsp;let &nbsp;but that &nbsp;they<br>
may lawfully have one<br>
form?"&mdash;<i>Hooker's</i><br>

<i>Polity."</i><br>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The following chapters are an attempt to explain in very
simple language the history and use of those parts of the
Church's fabric with which most persons are familiar.</p>

<p>They are not written with a view to assist the student of
Ecclesiastical Art and Architecture&mdash;for which purpose the
works of many learned writers are available&mdash;but simply to
inform those who, from having paid little attention to such pursuits,
or from early prejudice, may have misconceived the origin
and design of much that is beautiful and instructive in God's
House.</p>

<p>The spiritual and the material fabric are placed side by
side, and the several offices and ceremonies of the Church
as they are specially connected with the different parts of the
building are briefly noticed.</p>

<p>Some of the subjects referred to may appear trifling and
unimportant; those, however, among them which seem to be
the most trivial have in some parishes given rise to long and
serious disputations.</p>

<p>The unpretending narrative, which serves to embody the
several subjects treated of, has the single merit of being composed
of little incidents taken from real life.</p>

<p>The first sixteen chapters were printed some years since in
the <i>Church Builder</i>.</p>

<p>The writer is greatly indebted to the Committee of the
Incorporated Church Building Society for the use of most of
the woodcuts which illustrate the volume.</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"A</SPAN>ny port in a
storm, Mr.
Ambrose," said old
Matthew Hutchison,
as with tired feet, and
scant breath, he hastened
to share the
shelter which Mr.
Ambrose, the Vicar
of the Parish, had
found under the
ancient and time-worn
Lich-gate of St.
Catherine's Churchyard.
For a few big
drops of rain that
fell pattering on the
leaves around, had warned them both to seek protection from
a coming shower. "Ah, yes, my old friend," the Vicar replied,
"and here we are pretty near the port to which we must all
come, when the storm of life itself is past."</p>

<p>"I've known this place,&mdash;man and boy,&mdash;Mr. Ambrose, for
near eighty years; and on yonder bit of a hill, under that
broken thorn, I sit for hours every day watching my sheep; but
my eye often wanders across here, and then the thought takes
me just as you've said it, sir. Ah! it can't be long before Old
Matthew will need some younger limbs than these to bring him
through the churchyard gate;&mdash;that's what the old walls always
seem to say to me;&mdash;but God's will be done." And as the old
Shepherd reverently lifted his broad hat, his few white hairs,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
stirred by the rising gale, seemed to confirm the truth of his
words.</p>

<p>"Well, Matthew, I am glad you have learnt, what many are
slow to learn, that there are 'Sermons in stones,' as well as in
books. Every stone in God's House, and in God's Acre&mdash;as
our Churchyards used to be called,&mdash;may teach us some useful
lesson, if we will but stop to read it."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I should like to know why they call the gate
at the new churchyard over the hill, a <i>lich</i>-gate;&mdash;these new
names puzzle a poor man like me<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>."</p>

<p>"The name is better known in some parts of the country than
it is here; but it is no new name, I assure you, for in the time
of the Saxons, more than thirteen hundred years ago, it was in
common use; but I will tell you all about this, and some other
matters connected with the place where we now stand."</p>

<p>"I shall take it very kind if you will, sir, for you know we
poor people don't know much about these things."</p>

<p>"Very often quite as much as many who are richer, Matthew,&mdash;but
here comes our young squire, anxious like ourselves to
keep a dry coat on his back; so I shall now be telling my story
to rich and poor together, and I hope make it plain to both."
After a few words of friendly greeting between Mr. Acres and
himself, the three sat down on the stone seats of the Lich-Gate,
and he at once proceeded to answer the old Shepherd's question.
"The word <i>Lich</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>," he said, "means a <i>Corpse</i>, and so <i>Lich-Gate</i>
means a Corpse-gate, or gate through which the dead body is
borne; and that path up which you came just now, Matthew,
used formerly to be called the <i>Lich-path</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, because all the funerals
came along that way. In some parts of Scotland is still kept
up the custom of <i>Lyke-wake</i> (<i>Lich-wake</i>), or watching beside the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
dead body before its burial<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The pale sickly-looking moss,
which lives best where all else is dead or dying, we call <i>lichen</i>.
Then you know the <i>Lich-owl</i> is so called because some people
are silly enough to think that its screech foretells death. And
I must just say something about this word <i>lich</i> in the name of
a certain city; it is <i>Lichfield</i>. Now <i>lich-field</i> plainly means the
field of the dead: and where that city now stands is said
to have been the burial-place of many Christian Martyrs, who
were slain there about the year 290. You will remember, Mr.
Acres, that the Arms of the City exhibit this field of the dead,
on which lie three slaughtered men, each having on his head,
as is supposed, a martyr's crown. Now, Matthew, I think I
have fully replied to your question; but I should like to say
something more about the use and the history of these Lich-Gates."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<a name="image21" id="image21"></a>
<img src="images/illus021.jpg" width="351" height="257" alt="Lich-Gate at Birstal" title="">
</div>

<p>"Will you kindly tell us," said Mr. Acres, "how it is that<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>
there are so few remaining, and that of these there are probably
very few indeed so much as four centuries old<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p>

<p>"I think the reason is, that at first they were almost entirely
made of wood, and therefore were subject to early decay&mdash;certainly
they must at one time have been far more general
than at present. The rubrical direction at the beginning of the
Burial Office in our Prayer Book seems to imply some such
provision at the churchyard entrance. It is there said 'the
Priest and Clerks' are to 'meet the Corpse <i>at the entrance of
the Churchyard</i>.' But in this old Prayer Book of mine, printed
in the year 1549, you see the Priest is directed to meet the
corpse at the 'Church-stile,' or Lich-Gate. Now as in olden
times the corpse was always borne to its burial by the friends
or neighbours of the deceased, and they had often far to travel,
their time of reaching the Churchyard must have been very
uncertain, and this uncertainty no doubt frequently caused delay
when they had arrived, therefore it was desirable both to have
a place of shelter on a rainy day, and of rest when the way was
long. Hence I suppose it is, that the older Lich-Gates are to
be found, for the most part, in widespread parishes and
mountainous districts; they are most common in the Counties
of Devon and Cornwall, and in Wales<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. But even where the
necessity of the case no longer exists, the Lich-Gate, adorned,
as it ever should be, with some holy text or pious precept, is
most appropriate as an ornament, and expressive as a symbol.
Its presence should always be associated in our minds with
thoughts of death, and life beyond it. It should remind us
that though we must ere long 'go to the gates of the grave,' yet
that it is 'through the grave and gate of death' that we must<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
'pass to our joyful resurrection.' It is here the Comforter of
Bethany so often speaks, through the voice of His Church, to
His sorrowing brethren in the world:&mdash;'I am the resurrection
and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>."</p>

<p>"Ah! sir," said the shepherd, "many's the poor heart-bowed
mourner that's been comforted here with those words! They
always remind me of Jesus saying to the widow of Nain, 'Weep
not,' when he stopped the bier on which was her only son, and
the bearers, and all the mourners, at the gate of the city."</p>

<p>"Yes! and all this makes us look on the old Lich-Gate as no
gloomy object, but rather as a 'Beautiful Gate of the Temple'
which is eternal,&mdash;a glorious arch of hope and triumph, hung all
round with trophies of Christian victory. But I see the rain is
over, and the sun is shining! so good-bye, Mr. Acres, we two
shepherds must not stay longer from our respective flocks:&mdash;old
Matthew's is spread over the mountains, mine is folded in the
village below." The old shepherd soon took his accustomed seat
under the weather-beaten thorn, the Vicar was soon deep in the
troubles of a poor parishioner, and the young Squire went to
the village by another way.</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"G</span>ood morning, Mr. Acres, and a happy Easter-Tide to
you. This is indeed a bright Easter sun to shine on our
beautiful Lich-Gate at its re-opening. I little thought on what good
errand you were bent when last we parted at this spot. Hardly
however had I reached my door when William Hardy came with
great glee to tell me you had engaged his services for the work.
May God reward you, sir, for the honour you have shown for
His Church."</p>

<p>"And an old man's blessing be upon you, sir, if you will let
Old Matthew say so; for the Church-gate is dearer to me than
my own, seeing it has closed upon my beloved partner, and the
dear child God gave us, and my own poor wicket shuts on no
one else but me now."</p>

<p>"Thank you heartily, honest Matthew, and you too, sir," replied
the squire, giving to each the hand of friendship; "I am
rejoiced that what has been done pleases you so well. The
restored Gate is in every respect like the original one, even to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
the simple little cross on the top of it. I have added nothing
but the sentence from our Burial Office, 'Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord,' which you see over the arch, and which
I hope will bring comfort to some, and hope to all who read it.
But the work would never have been done by me, Mr. Vicar,
had you not so interested Matthew and myself in these Lich-Gates
when last we met. And so, as you see, your good words
have not been altogether lost, I hope you will kindly to-day
continue the subject of our last conversation."</p>

<p>"Most gladly will I do so; and as I have already spoken of
the general purpose and utility of these Lich-Gates, I will now
say a little about their construction and arrangement.</p>

<p>"Their most common form, as you know, is a simple shed
composed of a roof with two gable ends, covered either with tiles
or thatch, and supported on strong timbers well braced together.
But they are frequently built of stone, and in the manner of
their construction they greatly vary. At Burnsall there is a
curious arrangement for opening and closing the gate. The
stone pier on the north side has a well-hole, in which the weight
that closes the gate works up and down. An upright swivel
post or 'heart-tree,' (as the people there call it,) stands in the
centre, and through this pass the three rails of the gate; an iron
bent lever is fixed to the top of this post, which is connected by
a chain and guide-pulley to the weight, so that when any one
passes through, both ends of the gate open in opposite directions.
The Gate at Rostherne churchyard, in Cheshire, is on a similar
plan. At Berry-harbour is a Lich-Gate in the form of a cross.
At only one place, I believe,&mdash;Troutbeck, in Westmoreland,&mdash;are
there to be found three stone Lich-Gates in one churchyard.
Some of these gates have chambers over them, as at Bray<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, in
Berkshire, and Barking<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, in Essex. At Tawstock there is a
small room on either side of the gate, having seats on three sides
and a table in the centre. It seems that in this, as in some
other cases, provision is made either for the distribution of alms,<span class="pagenum">[Pg (/d)]</span>
or for the rest and refreshment of funeral attendants. It was
once a common custom at funerals in some parts, especially in
Scotland<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, to hold a feast at the Church-gate and these feasts
sometimes led to great excesses: happily they are now discontinued,
but the custom may help to point out the purpose for
which these Lich-Gate rooms were sometimes erected. In Cornwall
it is not customary to bear the corpse on the shoulders, but
to carry the coffin, under-handed, by white cloths passed beneath
and through the handles<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and this partly explains the peculiar
arrangement for resting the corpse at the entrance to the churchyard,
common, even now, in that county, and which is called the
<i>Lich-Stone</i>. The Lich-Stone is often found without any building
attached to it, and frequently without even a gate. The Stone is
either oblong with the ends of equal width, or it is the shape of the
ancient coffins, narrower at one end than the other, but without
any bend at the shoulder. It is placed in the centre, having stone
seats on either side, on which the bearers rest whilst the coffin
remains on the Lich-Stone. When there is no gate, the churchyard
is protected from the intrusion of cattle by this simple
contrivance:&mdash;long pieces of moor-stone, or granite, are laid
across, with a space of about three inches between each, and
being rounded on the top any animal has the greatest difficulty
in walking over them, indeed a quadruped seldom attempts to
cross them.</p>

<p>"Lich-Stones are,&mdash;though very rarely,&mdash;to be found at a
distance from the churchyard; in this case, doubtless, they are
intended as rests for the coffin on its way to burial.</p>

<p>"At Lustleigh, in Devonshire, is an octagonal Lich-Stone
called Bishop's Stone, having engraved upon it the arms of
Bishop Cotton<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. It seems not unlikely that the several beautiful
crosses erected by King Edward I. at the different stages<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
where the corpse of his queen, Eleanor<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, rested on its way from
Herdeby in Lincolnshire to Westminster, were built over the
Lich-Stone on which her coffin was placed. And now, my kind
listeners, I think I have told you all I know about Lich-Stones."</p>

</div>

<p>"These simple memorials of Church architecture are very
touching," replied Mr. Acres, as he rose to depart; "and the
Lich-Stone deserves a record before modern habits and improvements
sweep them away. They have a direct meaning, and
surely might be more generally adopted in connexion with the
Lich-Gate, now gradually re-appearing in many of our rural
parishes, as the fitting entrance to the churchyard."</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"A</span>nd so, Matthew, the old sexton's little daughter is to be buried
to-day. What a calm peaceful day it is for her funeral! The day itself
seems to have put on the same quiet happy smile that Lizzie Daniels
always carried about with her, before she had that painful lingering
sickness, which she bore with a meekness and patience I hardly ever saw equalled.
And then it is Easter Day too, the very day one would choose
for the burial of a good Christian child. All our services to-day
will tell us that this little maid, and all those who lie around us
here so still beneath their green mounds, are not dead but
sleeping, and as our Saviour rose from the grave on Easter Day,
so will they all awake and rise up again when God shall call
them. I see the little grave is dug under the old yew-tree,
near to that of your own dear ones. Lizzie was a great favourite
of yours, was she not, Matthew?"</p>

<p>"Ah, she was the brightest little star in my sky, I can tell<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
you, sir; and I shall miss her sadly. She brought me my dinner,
every day for near two years, up to the old thorn there, and then
she would sit down on the grass before me, and read from her
Prayer Book some of the Psalms for the day; and when she
had done, and I had kissed and thanked her, she used to go
trotting home again, with, I believe, the brightest little face
and the lightest little heart in England. Well, sir, it's sorry
work, you know, for a man to dig the grave for his own child,
and so I asked John Daniels to let me dig Lizzie's grave: but
it has been indeed hard work for me, for I think I've shed more
tears in that grave than I ever shed out of it. But the grave is
all ready now, and little Lizzie will soon be there; and then,
sir, I should like to put up a stone, for I shall often come here
to think about the dear child. Poor little Lizzie! she seemed
like a sort of good angel to me,&mdash;children do seem like that
sometimes, don't they, sir? Perhaps, Mr. Ambrose, you would
be so good as to tell Robert Atkinson what sort of stone you
would like him to put up."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will; and I think nothing would be so suitable
as a simple little stone cross, with Lizzie's name on the base of
it. And as she is to be buried on Easter Day, I should like to
add the words, 'In Christ shall all be made alive.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; that will do very nicely. I'm only thinking,
may be, that wicked boy of Mr. Dole's, at the shop, will
come some night and break the cross, as he did the one Mr.
Hunter put up over his little boy. But I think that was more
the sin of the father than of the son, for I'm told the old gentleman's
very angry with you, sir, 'cause he couldn't put what he
call's a 'handsome monument' over his father's grave; and he
says, too, he's going to law about it."</p>

<p>"Ah, he'll be wiser not to do that, Matthew. The churchyard
is the parson's freehold, and he has the power to prevent
the erection of any stone there of which he disapproves; and I,
for one, don't mean to give up this power. 'Tis true that every
one of my parishioners has a right to be buried in this churchyard,
nor could I refuse this if I would; but then, if I am to
protect this right of my parishioners, as it is my duty to do, and
to preserve my churchyard from disfigurement and desecration,
I must take care that the ground is not occupied by such great
ugly monuments as Mr. Dole wishes to build<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. Why I hear he<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
bought that large urn<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which was taken down from Mr. Acres'
park gates, to put on the top of the tomb. And then I suppose
he would like to have the sides covered with skulls and crossbones,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
and shovels and mattocks, and fat crying cherubs,
besides the usual heathen devices, such as inverted torches and
spent hour-glasses; all which fitly enough mark an infidel's
burial-place, but not a Christian's. For you see, my friend, that
<i>none of these things represent any Christian truth</i>; the best are
but emblems of mortality; some are the symbols of oblivion and
despair, and others but mimic a heathen custom long gone by.
The stones of the churchyard ought themselves to tell the sanctity
of the place, and that it is a Christian's rest<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. The letters
we carve on them will hardly be read by our children's children.
The lines on that stone there tell no more than is true of all the
Epitaphs around us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">'The record some fond hand hath traced,<br></span>
<span class="i1">To mark thy burial spot,<br></span>
<span class="i1">The lichen will have soon effaced,<br></span>
<span class="i1">To write thy doom&mdash;Forgot.'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>But even then, if the symbol of our redemption is there, 'the
very stones will cry out,' and though time-worn and moss-grown,
will declare that it is a <i>Christian's</i> burial-place. If, then, as
Christian men and women 'we sorrow not as others without
hope,' let us not cover our monuments with every symbol of
despair, or with heathen devices, but as we are not ashamed
of the doctrine, so neither let us be ashamed of the symbol
of the cross of Christ. Besides, if we wish to preserve our
graves from desecration, this form of stone is the most likely to
do so; for in spite of outrages like young Dole's, which have
been sometimes committed, we continually find that such memorials
have been respected and preserved when others have<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
been removed and employed for common uses. Why, Matthew,
I've seen hundreds of grave-stones converted into fire-hearths,
door-steps, pavements, and such like, but I never saw a monument
on which was graven the Christian symbol so desecrated;
and I believe such a thing has hardly ever been seen by any
one."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Ambrose, I should like there to be no doubt
about little Lizzie's being a Christian's grave. I was thinking,
too, to have a neat iron railing round the stone, sir."</p>

<p>"I would advise you not to have it, Matthew; for the grave
will be prettier without it. Besides, it gives an idea of separateness,
which one does not like in a place where all distinctions
are done away with; and, moreover, the iron would soon rust,
and then the railing would become very untidy."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure it would; I was forgetting that I shan't be
here to keep it nicely painted:&mdash;but see, sir, here come the
children from the village with their Easter flowers. I dare say
little Mary Acres will give me some for Lizzie's grave."</p>

<p>"Ah, I like that good old custom of placing flowers and
wreaths on Christian graves at Easter, and other special seasons<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.
It is the simple way in which these little ones both show their
respect for departed friends, and express their belief in the
resurrection of the dead. I would say of it, as Wordsworth
wrote of the Funeral Chant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Many precious rites<br></span>

<span class="i0">Are gone, or stealing from us; this, I hope,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will last for ever.'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>But you remember the time, Matthew, when there were very
different scenes from this, at Easter, in St. Catherine's churchyard.
If I mistake not, you will recollect when the Easter fair
used to be kept here."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>"That I do, sir, too well. There was always a Sunday fight
in the churchyard, and the people used to come from Walesborough
and for miles round to see it. It's just forty years ago
to-day poor Bill Thirlsby was killed in a fight, as it might be,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
just where I'm now standing<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. But, thank God, that day's
gone by."</p>

<p>"And, I trust, never to come back again. But have you
heard, Matthew, that some great enemies of the Church are
trying to spoil the peace and sacredness of our churchyards in
another way? They want to bring in all kinds of preachers to
perform all sorts of funeral services in them; and if they gain
their ends, our long-hallowed churchyards, where as yet there
has only been heard the solemn beautiful Burial Service of our
own Church, may be desecrated by the clamour of ignorant
fanaticism, the continual janglings of religious discord, or perhaps,
the open blasphemy of godless men."</p>

<p>"What! then I suppose we should have first a service from
Master Scoff, the bill-sticker and Mormon preacher, and next
from Master Scole, the Baptist preacher, then from Father La
Trappe, the Roman Catholic minister, and then, perhaps, sir,
it might be your turn. Why, sir, 'twould be almost like going
back to the Easter fair."</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, in one respect it would be worse; for it
would be discord all the year round. But I trust God will
frustrate these wicked designs of our Church's foes. Long, long
may it be ere the sanctity of our churchyards is thus invaded."</p>

<p>"Amen, say I to that, sir, with all my heart."</p>

<p>"And, thanks be to God, Matthew, that Amen of yours is
now re-echoing loudly throughout the length and breadth of
England."</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">A</span> golden haze in the eastern sky told that the sun
which had set in all his glory an hour before was now
giving a bright Easter Day to Christians in other lands.
The evening service was ended, and a joyful peal had just
rung out from the tower of St. Catherine's,&mdash;for such was the
custom there on all the great festivals of the Church,&mdash;the low
hum of voices which lately rose from a group of villagers gathered
near the churchyard gate was hushed; there was a pause of
perfect stillness; and then the old tenor began its deep,
solemn tolling for the burial of a little child. The Vicar
and his friend Mr. Acres, who had been walking slowly to
and fro on the churchyard path, stopped suddenly on hearing
the first single beat of the burial knell, and at the same
instant they saw, far down the village lane, the flickering
light of the two torches borne by those who headed the little
procession of Lizzie's funeral. They, too, seemed to have
caught the spell, and stood mutely contemplating the scene
before them. At length Mr. Acres broke silence by saying, "I
know of but few Parishes where, like our own, the funerals of
the poor take place by torch-light; it is, to say the least, a very
picturesque custom."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," replied Mr. Ambrose, "I believe, however, the
poor in this place first adopted it from no such sentiment, but
simply as being more convenient both to themselves and to their
employers. Their employers often cannot spare them earlier
in the day, and they themselves can but ill afford to lose a day's
wages. But these evening funerals have other advantages.
They enable many more of the friends of the departed to show
this last tribute of respect to their memory than could otherwise
do so; and were this practice more general, we should have<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
fewer of those melancholy funerals where the hired bearers are
the sole attendants. Then, if properly conducted, they save the
poor much expense at a time when they are little able to afford
it. I find that their poor neighbours will, at evening, give
their services as bearers, free of cost, which they cannot afford
to do earlier in the day. The family of the deceased, too, are
freed from the necessity of taxing their scanty means in
order to supply a day's hospitality to their visitors, who now
do not assemble till after their day's labour, and immediately
after the funeral retire to their own homes, and to rest. I
am sorry to say, however, this was not always so. When I
first came to the Parish, the evening was too often followed
by a night of dissipation. But since I have induced the people
to do away with hired bearers, and enter into an engagement to
do this service one for another, free of charge, and simply as a
<i>Christian duty</i>, those evils have never recurred. I once preached<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
a sermon to them from the text, 'Devout men carried Stephen
to his burial' (Acts viii. 2), in which I endeavoured to show them
that none but men of good and honest report should be selected
for this solemn office; and I am thankful to say, from that time
all has been decent and orderly. When it is the funeral of one
of our own school-children, the coffin is always carried by some
of the school-teachers; I need hardly say this is simply an act
of Christian charity. Moreover, this custom greatly diminishes
the number of our Sunday burials, which are otherwise almost
a necessity among the poor<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. The Sunday, as a great Christian
Festival, is not appropriate for a public ceremony of so
mournful a character as that of the burial of the dead; there
is, too, this additional objection to Sunday burials: that they
create <i>Sunday labour</i>. But, considering the subject generally, I
confess a preference for these evening funerals. To me they
seem less gloomy, though more solemn, than those which take
place in the broad light of day. When the house has been
closed, and the chamber of death darkened for several days (to
omit which simple acts would be like an insult to the departed),
it seems both consonant with this custom which we have universally
adopted, and following the course of our natural feelings, to
avoid&mdash;in performing the last solemn rite&mdash;the full blaze of
midday light. There is something in the noiseless going away
of daylight suggestive of the still departure of human life; and in
the gathering shades of evening, in harmony with one's thoughts
of the grave as the place of the <i>sleeping</i>, and not of the <i>dead</i>.
The hour itself invites serious thought. When a little boy, I
once attended a midnight funeral; and the event left an
impression on my mind which I believe will never be altogether
effaced. I would not, however, recommend midnight funerals,
except on very special occasions; and I must freely admit that
under many circumstances evening funerals would not be
practicable."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Acres, "that the system here adopted<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
obviates many evils which exist in the prevailing mode of
Christian burial, but it hardly meets the case of large towns,
especially when the burial must take place in a distant cemetery.
Don't you think we want reform there, even more, perhaps, than
in these rural parishes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, my friend, I do; and I regret to say I see,
moreover, many difficulties that beset our efforts to accomplish
it. Still something should be done. We all agree, it is much
to be deplored that, owing to the necessity for extramural
burial, the connexion between the parishioner and his parish
church is, with very rare exceptions, entirely severed in the last
office which the Clergy and his friends can render him, and the
solemn Service of the Burial of the Dead is said in a strange
place, by a stranger's voice. Now this we can at least partly
remedy. I would always have the bodies of the departed
brought to the parish church previous to their removal to the
cemetery; and the funeral knell should be tolled, as formerly, to
invite their friends and neighbours to be present, and take part
in so much of the service as need not be said at the grave.
It would then be no longer true, as now it is, that in many of
our churches this touching and beautiful Service has never been
said, and by many of the parishioners has never been heard.
Then let the bearers be men of good and sober character.
How revolting to one's sense of decency is the spectacle, so
common in London, of hired attendants, wearing funeral robes
and hat-bands<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, drinking at gin-palaces, whilst the hearse and
mourning coaches are drawn up outside! Then I would have
the furniture of the funeral less suggestive of <i>sorrow without
hope</i>; and specially I would have the coffin less gloomy,&mdash;I
might in many cases say, less <i>hideous</i>: let it be of plain wood,
or, if covered, let its covering be of less gloomy character, and
without the trashy and unmeaning ornaments with which undertakers
are used to bestud it. As regards our cemeteries, I
suppose in most of them the Burial Service is said in all its
integrity, but in some it is sadly mutilated. 'No fittings, sir,
and a third-class grave,' said the attendant of a large cemetery<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
the other day to a friend of mine, who had gone there to bury a
poor parishioner; which in simple English was this:&mdash;'The man
was too poor to have any other than a <i>common grave</i>, so you
must not read all the Service;
and his friends are too poor to
give a hat-band, so you must not
wear a hood and stole.' My
friend did not of course comply
with the intimation."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Vicar, I hope we
may see the improvements you
have suggested carried out, and
then such an abuse as that will
not recur. Much indeed has already
been done in this direction,
and for this we must be thankful."</p>

<p>"Yes, and side by side with
that, I rejoice to see an increasing
improvement in the
character of our tombstones and
epitaphs."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, there was need
enough, I am sure, for that.
How shocking are many of the
inscriptions we find on even
modern tombstones! To 'lie
like an epitaph' has long been a
proverb, and I fear a just one.
What a host of false witnesses
we have even here around us in
this burial-ground! There lies
John Wilk, who was&mdash;I suppose&mdash;as
free from care and sickness
to his dying hour as any man
that ever lived; yet his grave-stone
tells the old story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centpoem"><div class="centstanza">
'Afflictions sore long time I bore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicians was in vain.'<br>
</div></div>

<p>And beyond his stands the stone of that old scold Margery<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
Torbeck, who, you know, sir, was the terror of the whole
village; and of her we are told:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centpoem"><div class="centstanza">
'A tender wife, a mother dear,<br>
A faithful friend, lies buried here.'<br>
</div></div>

<p>I often think, Mr. Ambrose, when walking through a churchyard,
if people were only half as good when living, as when dead
they are said to have been, what a happy world this would be;
so full of 'the best of husbands,' 'the most devoted of wives,'
'the most dutiful of sons,' and 'the most amiable of daughters.'
One is often reminded of the little child's inquiry&mdash;'Mamma,
where are all the <i>wicked</i> people buried?' But did you ever
notice that vain and foolish inscription under the north wall to
the 'perpetual' memory of 'Isaac Donman, Esq.'? Poor man!
I wonder whether his friends thought the 'Esq.' would <i>perpetuate</i>
his memory. I wish it could be obliterated."</p>

<p>"I have told John Daniels to plant some ivy at the base of
the stone, and I hope the words will be hidden by it before the
summer is over. I find this the most convenient mode of concealing
objectionable epitaphs. But is it not an instance of
strange perversity, that where all earthly distinctions are swept
away, and men of all degrees are brought to one common level,
people will delight to inscribe these boastful and exaggerated
praises of the departed, and so often claim for them virtues
which in reality they never possessed? What can be more out
of place here than pride? As regards the frail body on which
is often bestowed so much vain eulogy, what truer words are
there than these?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How loved, how valued once, avails thee not;<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom related, or by whom begot:<br></span>
<span class="i0">A heap of dust alone remains of thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis all thou art, 'tis all the proud shall be.'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>These kind of epitaphs, too, are so very unfair to the deceased.
We who knew old Mrs. Ainstie, who lies under that grand
tombstone, knew her to be a good, kind neighbour; but posterity
will not believe that, when posterity reads in her epitaph
that 'she was a spotless woman.' It is better to say too little
than too much; since our Bibles tell us that, even <i>when we
have done all, we are unprofitable servants</i>. There are other<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
foolish epitaphs which are the result of ignorance, not of pride.
For instance, poor old Mrs. Beck, whose son is buried in
yonder corner (it is too dark now to see the stone), sent me
these lines for her son's grave-stone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Here lies John Beck, aged 19 years,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Father and mother, wipe away your tears.'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>I persuaded her instead to have this sentence from the Creed:&mdash;'I
believe in the communion of Saints.' When I explained to
her the meaning of the words, she was grateful that I had
suggested them.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<a name="image55" id="image55"></a>
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="351" height="320" alt="Grave-Stones" title="">
</div>

<p>The two things specially to be avoided in these memorials
are flattery and falsehood; and, moreover, we should always
remember that neither grave-stone nor epitaph can benefit the
<i>dead</i>, but that both may benefit the <i>living</i>. Therefore a short
sentence from the Bible or Prayer Book, expressive of hope beyond
the grave, is always appropriate; such as:&mdash;'I look for the
resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come;' or
words which either may represent the dying prayer of the deceased,
or express a suitable petition for ourselves when thus<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
reminded of our own approaching departure, such as: 'Jesus,
mercy,' or 'God be merciful to me a sinner,' or 'In the hour of
death, good Lord, deliver us.' How much better is some simple
sentence like these than a fulsome epitaph! But the funeral is
nearly at the gate; so I must hasten to meet it."</p>

<p>"And I will say good evening," said Mr. Acres, "as I may
not see you after the service; and I thank you for drawing my
attention to a subject on which I had before thought too little."</p>

<p>Mr. Ambrose met the funeral at the lich-gate. First came
the two torch-bearers, then the coffin, borne by six school-teachers;
then John and Mary Daniels, followed by their two
surviving children; then came old Matthew, and after him
several of little Lizzie's old friends and neighbours. Each attendant
carried a small sprig of evergreen<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, or some spring flowers,
and, as the coffin was being lowered, placed them on it. Many
tears of sadness fell down into that narrow grave, but none told
deeper love than those of the old Shepherd, who lingered
sorrowfully behind to close in the grave of his little friend.</p>

<h2>THE PORCH</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">M</span>r. Ambrose only remained in the churchyard a
few moments after little Lizzie's funeral, just to say
some kind words to the bereaved parents and the attendant
mourners, and then hastened to comply with the urgent request
of a messenger, that he would without delay accompany
him to the house of a parishioner living in a distant part of the
Parish.</p>

<p>It was more than an hour ere the Vicar began to retrace his
steps. His nearest way to the village lay through the churchyard,
along the path he had lately traversed in earnest conversation
with Mr. Acres. He paused a moment at the gate, to
listen for the sound of Matthew's spade; but the old man had
completed his task, and all was still. He then entered, and
turned aside to look at the quiet little grave. A grassy mound
now marked the spot, and it was evident that no little care had
been bestowed to make it so neat and tidy.</p>

<p>Mr. Ambrose was slowly walking on, musing on the patient
sufferings of his little friend, now gone to her rest, when just as
he approached the beautiful old porch of the church his train of
thought was suddenly disturbed by hearing what seemed to him
the low, deep sobbing of excessive grief. The night was not so
dark but that he could see distinctly within the porch, and he
anxiously endeavoured to discover whether the sound had proceeded
from any one who had taken shelter there for the night;
but the place was evidently tenant less. "It must have been
only the hum of a passing breeze, which my fancy has converted
into a human voice," thought he, "for assuredly no such restless
sobs as those ever escape from the deep sleepers around me<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
here." And so the idea was soon banished and forgotten. But
as he stood there, his gaze became, almost unconsciously, fixed
upon the old church porch. The dim light resting upon it
threw the rich carvings of its graceful arches, and deep-groined
roof, with its massive bosses of sculptured stone, into all sorts
of fantastic forms, and a strange mystery seemed to hang about
the solemn pile, which completely riveted his attention to it, and
led him into the following reverie:&mdash;"Ah, thou art indeed a
'beautiful gate of the temple'! Well and piously did our
ancestors in bestowing so much wealth and labour to make thy
walls so fair and lovely. And well ever have they done in
crowding these noble porches with the sacred emblems of our
holy faith. Rightly have they deemed that the very highest
efforts of human art could not be misapplied in adorning the
threshold of God's House, so that, ere men entered therein,
their minds might be attuned to the solemnity of the place<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.
All praise, too, to those honest craftsmen who cemented these
old stones so well together that they have stood the storms of centuries,
and still remain the unlettered though faithful memorials
of ages long gone by. Ah, how many scenes my imagination calls
up as I look on this old porch! Hundreds of years ago most of
the sacred offices of our Church were there in part performed.
Now, I think I see the gay bridal party standing in that dusky
portal<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; there comes the Priest to join the hands of the young
and happy pair; he pronounces over them the Church's blessing;
and the bridegroom endows with her bridal portion her whom
he has sworn to love till one shall die. A thousand brides and
bridegrooms, full of bright hopes of happy years, have been
married in that porch. Centuries ago they grew old and died,
and were buried in this churchyard, but the old porch still remains<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>
in all its beauty and all its strength. There, kneeling
upon that well-worn pavement, I see the mother pour forth her
thankfulness to God for her deliverance from sickness, and for
the babe she bears<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. And now, still beneath that porch, she
gives her tender infant into the arms of God's priest, that he may
present it to Him in holy Baptism. In yon dark corner I seem
to see standing the notorious breaker of God's commands; his
head is bent down with shame, and he is clothed in the robe of
penance<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. Now the scene is changed: the old walls resound
with the voices of noisy disputants&mdash;it is a parish meeting<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, and
passions long since hushed find there a clamorous expression;
but there stands the stately form of the peace-maker, and the
noisy tongue of the village orator is heard no more. Yes, rise
up, Sir Knight, who, with thy hands close clasped as if in ceaseless
prayer, hast lain upon that stony couch for five long centuries,
and let thy manly step be heard beneath that aged roof
once more; for, though a warrior, thou wast a good and peace-loving
man, and a devout worshipper in this temple, or, I trust,
thy burial-place would never have been in this old porch<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Vicar were fixed upon the recumbent effigy
of an old knight lying beneath its stone canopy on the western<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
side of the porch (of which, however, only a dim outline was
visible), when the same sound that had before startled him was
repeated, followed by what seemed the deep utterance of earnest
prayer, but so far off as to be but faintly heard. He stood in
motionless attention for a short time, and then the voice ceased.
He then saw a flickering light on one of the farthest windows of
the chancel; slowly it passed from window to window, till it
reached that nearest to the spot where he was standing. Then
there was a narrow line of light in the centre of the doorway;
gradually it widened, and there stood before him the venerable
form of the old shepherd.</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"T</span>he Vicar's
first impulse,
on recovering from
his surprise at so unexpectedly
meeting
with the old Shepherd
in such a
place, at such an
hour, was, if possible,
to escape unnoticed,
and to
leave the churchyard
without suffering
him to know
what he had heard
and seen; but at
that instant the
light fell full upon him, and concealment was impossible.</p>

<p>"You'll be surprised, Mr. Ambrose," said the old man, "at
finding me in the church at this late time. But it has, I assure
you, been a great comfort for me to be here."</p>

<p>"My good friend," replied the Vicar, "I know you have
been making good use of God's House, and I only wish there
were more disposed to do the like. I rejoice to hear you have
found consolation, for to-day has been one of heavy sorrow to
you, and you needed that <i>peace which the world cannot give</i>.
How often it is that <i>we cannot understand these trials until we
go into the House of the Lord</i>, and then God makes it all plain
to us."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>"I've learnt that to-night, sir, as I never learnt it before.
When I had put the last bit of turf on the little grave, and
knew that all my work was over, there was such a desolate,
lonely-like feeling came over me, that I thought my old heart
must break; and then, all of a sudden, it got into my head that
I would come into the church. But it was more dull and
lonesome there than ever. It was so awful and quiet, I became
quite fearful and cowed, quite like a child, you know, sir.
When I stood still, I hardly dared look round for fear I should
see <i>something</i> in the darkness under the old grey arches, and
when I moved, the very noise of my footsteps, which seemed
to sound in every corner, frightened me. However, I took
courage, and went on. Then I opened this Prayer Book, and
the first words I saw were these in the Baptismal Service:&mdash;'<i>Whosoever
shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child,
he shall not enter therein.</i>' So I knelt down at the altar rails
and prayed, as I think I never prayed before, that I might in
my old age become as good as the little maid I had just buried,
and be as fit to die as I really believe she was. Then I said
those prayers you see marked in the book, sir (she put the
marks), and at last I came to those beautiful words in the
Communion Service (there is a cross put to them, and I felt
sure she meant me particularly to notice them):&mdash;'<i>We bless
and praise Thy holy Name for all Thy servants departed this
life in Thy faith and fear.</i>' I stood up, and said that over and
over again; and as I did so, somehow all my fear and lonesomeness
went away, and I was quite happy. It was <i>this</i> that
made me so happy: I felt sure, sir, quite sure, that my poor
dear wife and our child and little Lizzie were close to me. I
could not see nor hear them, but for all that I was somehow
quite certain that they were there rejoicing with me, and
praising God for all the good people He had taken to Himself.
Oh! I shall never forget this night, sir; the thought of it will
always make me happy. You will never see me again so cast
down as I have been lately."</p>

<p>"Well, Matthew, you cannot at least be wrong in allowing
what you have felt and believed to fix more firmly in your
faith the Church's glorious doctrine of the <i>communion of
saints</i>."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>For some time each stood following out in his own mind
the train of thought which these words suggested. Matthew
was the first to break silence, by begging the Vicar kindly to
go with him into the room above where they were standing, as
he wished there to ask a favour of him.</p>

<p>Matthew returned into the church to find the key of the
chamber, and Mr. Ambrose at once recognized the volume
which he had left on the stone seat of the porch, as that from
which Lizzie was used to read when she sat beside the old
Shepherd on the neighbouring hill. He took it up, and, opening
it at the Burial Office, he found there a little curl of lovely
fair hair marking the place. The page was still wet&mdash;it was the
dew of evening, gentle tears of love and sorrow shed by one
whose night was calmly and peacefully coming on.</p>

<p>The old man soon returned with the key, and, bearing the
lantern, led the way up a narrow, winding stone staircase, formed
in the masonry of a large buttress, to the little chamber. As
soon as they had reached it, he said, "Before I beg my favour,
Mr. Ambrose, I should much like you to tell me something
about this old room. Ever since I was a boy it has been a sort
of lumber-room, but I suppose it was not built for that?"</p>

<p>"Well, Matthew, there is not much here to throw light upon
the history of this particular chamber; but I will tell you what
I can about such places generally. The room is most commonly,
but not correctly, called the <i>parvise</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. The word <i>parvise</i>, or
<i>paradise</i>, properly only applies to an open court adjoining a
church, and surrounded by cloisters; but in olden times a room
in a private house was sometimes called a paradise<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, and hence,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>
I suppose, the name came to be used for the porch-room of the
church. It was also called the <i>priest's chamber</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; and such, I
think, was the room in which we now are. You see it is provided
with a nice little fire-place<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, and it is a comfortable little
place to live in. Sometimes it was called the <i>treasury</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, or
record-room, because the parish records and church books were
kept in it; or the <i>library</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, from its being appropriated for the
reception of a church or parochial library. There are many of
these chambers furnished with valuable libraries which have
been bequeathed from time to time for this purpose. It is also
evident, from the remains of an altar and furniture connected
with it, that not infrequently it was built for a <i>chapel</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. Occasionally
it has been used as the <i>parish school</i><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; and I have heard<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>
that in some of the eastern counties poor people have occasionally,
in cases of extreme distress, claimed sanctuary or
refuge, both in the porch and parvise, and lived there undisturbed
for some weeks together. But latterly, in many places, the
parish clerk or sexton has been located in the parvise, that he
may watch the churchyard and protect the church<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; and I am
inclined to think this is a much more sensible thing to do, than
to give up the room to the owls and bats, as is very often the case
now, but even that is better than to use it as it has sometimes
been used&mdash;as a common prison<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that, sir, for it makes the way
for me to ask my favour. John Daniels wants to give up the
place of sexton; and as I am getting too old now to walk far,
and to take care of the sheep as I used to do, I'm going to
make so bold as to ask you to let me be sexton in his stead,
and to live in this little room, if you please, sir. I could then
keep the key of the church, and it would be always at hand
when wanted: I should be near to ring the bell for morning
and evening prayer; I could watch the churchyard, and see
that no one breaks the cross on Lizzie's grave&mdash;I shall be able
to see it from this window. And then, sir, if you will have this
little window opened again into the church<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, why I can keep<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>
guard over the church too; and that's rather necessary just now,
for several churches about us have been robbed lately. Besides
all this, the room is much more warm and comfortable than
mine in the village, and I shall enjoy the quiet of it so much."</p>

<p>"Most glad, Matthew, shall I be to see the office of sexton in
such good hands. You will not yourself be equal to all the
work, but you will always be able to find a younger hand when
you need one. And then, with regard to your living here, it's
just the thing I should like, for, apart from other reasons, it
would enable me to have the church doors always open to those
who would resort thither for prayer or meditation. It is a sad
thing for people to be deprived of such religious retirement. I
almost wish that the church porch could be made without a
church door altogether, as it used to be<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, and then the church
would be always open. But, my friend, have you considered
how gloomy, and lonely, and unprotected this place will be?"</p>

</div>

<p>"You mus'n't say <i>gloomy</i>, if you please, sir; I trust and
believe my gloomy days are past; and lonely I shall not be:
you remember my poor daughter's little boy that was taken out<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
to Australia by his father (ah! his name almost <i>does</i> make
me gloomy&mdash;but, God forgive him!)&mdash;he is coming home next
week to live with me. He is now seven years old; I hear he is
a quiet, old-fashioned boy. He will be a nice companion for me,
and I hope you will let him help in the church; but we can
speak of that again. Then for protection, sir, you must let my
fond old dog be with me at nights; the faithful fellow would
die of grief were we altogether parted. Come, sir, it's an old
man's wish, I hope you'll grant it." This last sentence was
said as they were returning down the little winding staircase
back to the porch.</p>

<p>"It shall be as you wish; next week the room shall be ready
for you. And as I have granted all the requests you have
made, you must grant me one in return. You must let me
furnish the room for you. No, I shall not listen to any objections;
this time <i>I</i> must have <i>my</i> way. Good night."</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"W</span>hy, my dear Constance,"
said Mr. Acres, as one
morning he found the eldest of his
three children sitting gloomy and
solitary at the breakfast-room window,
"you look as though all the cares
of the nation were pressing upon you!
Come, tell me a few of them; unless,"
added he, laughingly, "my little
queen thinks there is danger to the
State in communicating matters of
such weighty import."</p>


<p>"Oh, don't make fun of me, dear
Papa! I have only one trouble just
now, and you will think that a very
little one; but you know you often
say little troubles seem great to little
people."</p>

<p>"Then we must have the bright
little face back again at once, if, after
all, it is only one small care that
troubles it," said he, kissing her affectionately.
"But now, my darling,
let me know all about it."</p>

<p>"Well, Papa, I think it's too bad
of Mary to go up to the church again
to-day to help Ernest to take more rubbing's of those dull,
stupid old brasses. I don't care any thing about them, and I
think it's nonsense spending so much time over them as they
do. I wish Mr. Ambrose would not let them go into the
church any more, and then Mary would not leave me alone
like this."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>"That's not a very kind wish, Constance, as they both seem
so much interested in their work; but I dare say this is the last
day they will give to it. Suppose we go this afternoon to look
after them: we can then ask Ernest to bring home all the
copies he has taken, and when Mr. Ambrose comes in by-and-by,
perhaps he will tell us something about them; and who
knows but your unconsciously offending enemies may turn out
to be neither dull nor stupid, after all?"</p>

<p>The proposal was gladly accepted, and at four o'clock they
were enjoying their pleasant walk up to St. Catherine's Church.</p>

<p>As they entered the church Mr. Acres heard, to his surprise,
the clear ring of Mary's happy laugh. She was standing in the
south aisle, beside the paper on which she had been vainly
attempting to copy a monumental brass. Seeing her father
approach with a serious and somewhat reproving countenance,
she at once guessed the cause, and anticipated the reprimand he
was about to utter. "You must not be angry with me, Papa,"
she said, in a very subdued tone, "for indeed I could not help
laughing, though I know it is very wrong to laugh in church;
but, you know, I had just finished my rubbing of the brass
here, and thought I had done it so well, when all of a sudden
the paper slipped, and the consequence was that my poor
knight had two faces instead of one; and he looked so queer
that I could not help laughing at him very much."</p>

<p>"No doubt, my dear child," said her father, "there was something
in your misfortune to provoke a laugh, but I think you
must have forgotten for a moment the sacredness of this place,
when you gave vent to the merry shout I heard just now. You
should always remember that in God's house you are standing
on <i>holy ground</i>, and though it may be permissible for us to go
there for the purpose of copying those works of art, which in
their richest beauty are rightly dedicated to God and His service,
and these curious monuments which you and Ernest have
been tracing, yet we should ever bear with us a deep sense of the
sanctity of the building as the 'place where His honour dwelleth,'
and avoid whatever may give occasion to levity; or should the
feeling force itself upon us, we ought, by a strong effort, to
resist it."</p>

<p>Although the words were spoken in a kind and gentle voice,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>
many tears had already fallen upon Mary's spoilt tracing, so her
father said no more on the subject; but, taking her hand, led
her quietly away to a chapel at the north-east corner of the
church, round which was placed a beautifully carved open
screen. It was the burial-place of the family that formerly
tenanted the Hall, and there were many brass figures and
inscriptions laid in the floor to their memory. Here, attentively
watched by old Matthew the sexton, Ernest was busily engaged
tracing the figure of a knight in armour, represented as standing
under a handsome canopy. He had already completed his
copy of the canopy, and of the inscription round the stone, and
was now engaged at the figure. Two sheets of paper were
spread over the stone, and he had guarded against Mary's
accident by placing on the paper several large kneeling hassocks,
which were used by the old people. He was himself half reclining
on a long cushion laid on the pavement, and having before
marked out with his finger on the paper the outlines of the brass
underneath it, was now rubbing away vigorously with his heel-ball<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>,
and at every stroke a little bit more of the knight came
out upon the paper, till, like a large black drawing, the complete
figure appeared before them. They had all watched Ernest's
labours with the greatest interest, and, this being the last, they
assisted in rolling up the papers, that they might be taken home
for more careful examination in the evening.</p>

<p>"I wish Master Ernest could take a picture of good old Sir
John, as we call him, Mr. Acres," said Matthew; "I mean him
as lies in the chancel, right in front of the altar; but he's cut
out in the flat stone, and not in the metal, so I suppose Master
Ernest can't do it. I remember the time, sir, when people as
were sick and diseased used to come for miles round to lie
upon that stone, and they believed it made them much better<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>;
and if they believed it, I dare say it did, sir. And 'tisn't but a
very few years back when it would have been thought very unlucky
indeed if a corpse had not rested over good Sir John all
night before its burial. We still place the coffins just in the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>
same place at the funerals, but of course nobody any longer believes
that good Sir John can do good or ill to those inside them."</p>

<p>"I must bring some stronger paper than that I use for the
brasses, to copy the stone figure, Matthew," said Ernest; "so
that must be done another day."</p>

<p>All said good-bye to the old sexton, and as he wended his way
up the narrow stone stairs to his little chamber, Mr. Acres and
his family returned to Oakfield Hall.</p>

<p>The dining-room was soon decorated with the trophies of
Ernest's four days' labour, and other rubbing's which he had before
taken; and when Mr. Ambrose arrived he was met by several
eager petitioners, praying him to give some explanation of the
strange-looking black and white figures that hung upon the walls.</p>

<p>"It would take me a whole day to tell you all that might be
said about them," said he; "but I shall be very glad to give you
a short description of each, and I will follow the course which
Ernest has evidently intended me to adopt, for I see he has
arranged all the bishops and priests together, and the knights,
the civilians, and the ladies, each class by itself. But first I
must tell you something of the general history of these brass
memorials. There are an immense number of them in this
country&mdash;it is supposed about 4000&mdash;and they are chiefly to be
found in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Kent; but indeed there
are comparatively few old churches in England in which you
cannot find upon the pavement some traces of these interesting
memorials. Though, however, so many remain, probably not
less than 20,000 have been either stolen or lost. You will see
on the pavement at St. Catherine's, marks of the force which has
been used in tearing many from the stones in which they had
been firmly fixed."</p>

<p>"But who could have been so fearless and wicked as to take
them away?" exclaimed Constance, who already had begun to
feel a real interest in the subject.</p>

<p>"Alas! Constance, that question is easily answered. There
was indeed a time, long ago, when people would not have
<i>dared</i> to commit these acts of sacrilege. You know among
the ancient Romans there was a belief that the manes or
spirits of the departed protected their tombs, and so persons
were afraid to rob them; but people since then have<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>
been deterred by no such fear, indeed by no fear at all. Within
the period between 1536 and 1540 somewhere about 900 religious
houses were destroyed, and their chapels were dismantled
and robbed of their tombs, on which were a great number
of brasses. And this spirit of sacrilege extended beyond the
monasteries, for at this time, and afterwards, very many of our
parish churches were also despoiled of their monumental brasses;
indeed the evil spread so much that Queen Elizabeth issued a
special proclamation for putting a stop to it. The greatest destruction
of brasses, however, took place a hundred years after
this, when thousands were removed from the cathedrals and
churches to satisfy the rapacity or the fanaticism of the Puritan
Dissenters, who were then in power<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. In later times, I am sorry
to say, large numbers have been sold by churchwardens, for the
just value of the metal, and many have been removed during the
restoration of churches and have not been restored; of course,
those whose special duty it was to protect them have been
greatly to blame for this. Then not a few have become loose,
and been lost through mere carelessness. Some of the most<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
beautiful brasses in our church I discovered a few years since
under a heap of rubbish in the wood-house of Daniels, the
former sexton<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. So you see it is no wonder we find so many
of those curiously-indented slabs in the pavement of our churches,
which mark the places where brasses have formerly been.</p>

<p>A few of these memorials are to be found in Wales, Ireland,
and Scotland. Some also exist in France, Germany, Russia,
Prussia, Poland, Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, and Sweden.
In these countries, however, they have never been numerous.</p>

<p>But now I must say a few words about their origin. The
oldest memorials of the dead to be found in our churches
are the stone coffin-lids, with plain or floriated crosses carved
upon them. The stone coffins were buried just below the level
of the pavement, so their lids were even with the floor of the
church. Afterwards, similar crosses were graven on slabs of
stone above the coffin; then the faces of the deceased were
represented; and at length whole figures, and many other devices,
were carved on the stone, and around the stone was
sometimes an inscription consisting of letters of <i>brass</i> separately
inlaid. Then the figures and inscriptions were either altogether
made of brass, or were partly graven in stone and partly in
brass; specimens of both, I see, Ernest has provided for us.
The earliest of these incised slabs are probably of the ninth
century, but the faces of the deceased were not carved on them
till about 1050. The earliest brass of which we have any
account is that of Simon de Beauchamp, 1208; and the most
ancient brass figure now remaining is that of Sir John Daubernoun,
1277.</p>

<p>"The form of the brass has evidently been often suggested
by the stone and marble effigies we see on altar-tombs. For
we find that not only the costume and position of the figures
are closely copied, but also the canopies above them, the
cushions or helmets on which their heads rest, and the lions,
dogs, or other animals on which the feet are placed. I have
something more to say on the subject generally, before I come
to speak particularly about Ernest's copies; so after the general
interval of ten minutes I will resume the subject.</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">A</span>s soon as the short pause
was over, all ears were
open to learn something more on
a subject which had been hitherto
entirely without interest to most
of the Vicar's little audience.</p>


<p>"We find sometimes upon the
pavement of our churches," said
Mr. Ambrose, "memorials just
like those I have spoken to you
about, except that they are made
of <i>iron</i> or <i>lead</i> instead of brass,
but they are comparatively very
rare, and, except in the metal of
which they are composed, differ
nothing from the <i>brasses</i>.</p>

<p>"Sepulchral brasses must have
been a great ornament to our
churches before they were despoiled
of their beauty by the hand
of Time, and the still less sparing
hand of man. The vivid colours of
the enamel with which they were
inlaid, and the silvery brightness
of the yet untarnished lead which
was employed to represent the
ermine and other parts of official costume, must have added
greatly to the splendour of these monuments. At first they
were no doubt very costly, for there appear to have been but<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>
few places where they were made in this country, and, in addition
to the cost of the brasses themselves, the expense of their carriage
in those times must have been considerable. A great
many of these monuments, however, are of foreign manufacture,
and were chiefly imported from Flanders. It is easy to distinguish
between the English and the Flemish brasses, for
whereas the former are composed of separate pieces of metal
laid in different parts of the stone, and giving the distinct
outline of the figure, canopy, inscription, &amp;c., the latter are
composed of several plates of brass placed closely together
and engraved all over with figures, canopies, and other designs.
The later English brasses are, however, very similar to the
Flemish. You see that little copy of a brass about three feet
long by one foot deep which Ernest has somehow obtained
from the church at Walton-on-Thames? Now that is a square
piece of metal just like those they made in Flanders, but it
was evidently engraved in England. It is dated 1587, and is
in memory of John Selwyn, keeper of Queen Elizabeth's park
at Oatlands, near Walton. It represents, as you see, a stag
hunt, and is said to refer to this incident:&mdash;'The old keeper,
in the heat of the chase, suddenly leaped from his horse upon
the back of the stag (both running at that time with their
utmost speed), and not only kept his seat gracefully, in spite
of every effort of the affrighted beast, but, drawing his sword,
with it guided him to wards the Queen, and coming near her
presence, plunged it in his throat, so that the animal fell dead
at her feet<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.'"</p>

<p>"But, my friend," said Mr. Acres, "it seems to me that the
record of such an event, even if it ever happened&mdash;which I
must take the liberty to doubt&mdash;is quite as objectionable as
any of those epitaphs in our churchyard which you once so
strongly and justly condemned."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you. But this was made at a time when
sepulchral monuments were frequently of a very debased character.
At this period the brasses underwent a great change.
They began to rise from their humble position on the pavement,
and the figures were occasionally made without their devotional<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>
posture, which up to this date had been almost universal.
They were then placed on the church walls, on tablets, or on
the top and at the back of altar-tombs, and this led the way
for the erection of a large number of monuments in stone
of similar design, but more cumbrous and inconvenient.
Inferior workmen also were evidently employed at this
time to engrave the brasses, and they became more and
more debased, till they reached the lowest point of all, a
hundred years ago, and soon after their manufacture altogether
ceased. It was near the time when this brass was put
up to the old park-keeper, that that ugly monument in memory
of Sir John York, with its four heathen obelisks, and its four
disconsolate Cupids, was put up in our chancel, covering so
much of the floor as to deprive at least twenty persons of their
right to a place in God's House. About this time, too, that
uncomfortable looking effigy of Lady Lancaster was put upon
its massive altar-tomb. To judge from the position of her
Ladyship, and hundreds of other similar monuments, represented
as reclining and resting the face upon the hand, we
might imagine that a large proportion of the population in those
days died of the toothache. However, the attitude of prayer
was that most commonly adopted, as well in stone as brass
effigies, till long after this period.</p>

<p>"If any thing more than the figure, canopy, inscription, and
shield is represented on a brass, it is commonly a sacred symbol,
a trade mark, or some badge of rank or profession. To this
there are but a few exceptions, besides the brass of John Selwyn.
At Lynn, in Norfolk, on one brass is a hunting scene, on another
a harvest-home, such as it was in the year 1349, and on another
a peacock feast, the date of which is 1364. Founders of
churches frequently hold in their hands the model of a church.
The emblem of undying love we find in the heart, either alone
or held by both hands of the effigy. A long epitaph was often
avoided by the simple representation of a chalice, a sword, an
ink-horn, a wool-sack, a barrel, shears, or some such trade or
professional emblem. Some&mdash;comparatively few&mdash;of the inscriptions
on brasses are, however, profusely long, and sometimes,
but very rarely, ridiculous.</p>

<p>In very early times the epitaphs were always written in Latin<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>
or Norman French; and if that practice had continued, it
would not much matter to persons generally even if they were
absurd, as few could read them: but about the year 1400
they began to be written in English, and then of course these
foolish inscriptions must have been distracting to the thoughts
of those who attended the church. But it very often happened
that persons had their brasses put down some time before their
decease, as is evident from the circumstance that in many cases
the dates have never been filled in. This custom would much
tend to prevent foolish and flattering inscriptions.</p>

<p>"I have noticed that there is in nearly all brasses a solemn
or serious expression in the countenance suitable to their presence
in God's House. They were frequently <i>portraits</i> of the
persons commemorated<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. This was no doubt the case in later
brasses, and I think in the earlier also. Latterly the faces
were sometimes coloured, no doubt to represent the originals
more exactly. It seldom happens that the age of the person
is otherwise than pretty faithfully portrayed.</p>

the soldiers, and the civilians, as we see them engraved upon
the pavements of our churches."</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"T</span>hat costumes are pretty
accurately represented on
brasses," continued Mr. Ambrose, "we
are sure, from the fact that many different
artists have made the dresses of
each particular period so much alike;
and this circumstance adds much
interest and importance to these
monuments. I will now describe
some of these dresses, and you must
try to find out, as I go on, the
several parts of the dress I am describing
on Ernest's rubbing's which
hang upon the wall. But I shall
only be able to say a little about
each. First there come the persons
holding sacred office in the Church.
The priests are usually, you see,
dressed in the robes worn at Holy
Communion, and they commonly
hold the chalice and wafer in their
hands. The robe which is most conspicuous is the <i>chasuble</i>.
It is usually richly embroidered in gold and silk. This robe
is one of the ornaments of the minister referred to in the rubric
at the commencement of the Prayer Book. At the top of it
you see the <i>amice</i>. This too is worked in various colours and
patterns. The academic <i>hood</i>, some suppose, now represents
this part of the priest's dress. You must remember we are
looking at the dresses worn five hundred years ago, and which
had been in use long before that time, and we cannot be<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>
surprised if some of them, as now worn, are a little changed
in shape and appearance. The narrow band which hangs
from the shoulders nearly to the feet, embroidered at the
ends, is called the <i>stole</i>. This, you know, is still worn by us
just as it was then. It is one of the most ancient vestments
of the Church, and is intended to represent the <i>yoke of Christ</i>.
The small embroidered strip hanging on the left arm is the
<i>maniple</i>. It is used for cleaning the sacred vessels. Beneath
the chasuble is the <i>albe</i>, a white robe which&mdash;changed somewhat
in form&mdash;we still wear. It is derived from the linen ephod of
the Jews. Sometimes on brasses, as on that beautiful one to the
memory of Henry Sever<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, the <i>cope</i> is represented. This is a
very rich and costly robe, and is still always worn at the coronations
of our Kings and Queens; it is also ordered to be worn
on other occasions. Then the bishops wore, you see, other
robes besides those I have mentioned:&mdash;the <i>mitre</i>, like the
albe, handed down from the time of the Jews to our own
period; the <i>tunic</i>, a close-fitting linen vestment; the <i>dalmatic</i>,
so called because it was once the regal dress of Dalmatia;
the gloves, often jewelled. They hold the <i>crozier</i>, or <i>cross
staff</i>, or else the <i>crooked</i>, or <i>pastoral staff</i>, in their hand. As
bishops and priests were then, as now, very often buried in
their ecclesiastical vestments, the brass probably in such cases
represented, as near as could be, the robed body of the person
beneath. The earliest brasses of ecclesiastics are at Oulton,
Suffolk, and Merton College, Oxford. The date of both is about
1310.</p>

<p>"We must next come to the monumental brasses of <i>knights</i>
and warriors; and that curious brass to Sir Peter Legh, which
is taken from Winwick Church, will do well for a connecting
link between the clergy and the warriors. He is, you see, in
armour, but over the upper part of it is a chasuble, on the front
of which is his shield of arms. And this tells his history. He
was formerly a soldier, but at the decease of his wife he relinquished
his former occupation, and became a priest of the
Church. You see before you soldiers in all kinds of armour, and
you can easily trace the gradual change from the <i>chain mail</i> to
the <i>plated armour</i>, till you find the former almost entirely abandoned,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>
and the latter adopted, in the early part of the fifteenth
century. Now I should soon tire you if I were to describe all
the curious sorts of armour these soldiers wear, so I must just
take one of them, and that will go far to wards explaining others.
There hangs Sir Roger de Trumpington<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, of Trumpington,
Cambridgeshire; his date is 1289. You see he is cross-legged,
and so you would put him down for a Knight Templar, and a
warrior in the Holy Land. And so he was; but nevertheless
you must remember all cross-legged figures are not necessarily
Knights Templar. He rests his head upon a <i>bascinet</i> (<span class="smcap">A</span>), or
helmet. His head and neck are protected by chain mail (<span class="smcap">B</span>),
to which is attached his <i>hauberk</i> (<span class="smcap">D</span>), or shirt of mail. On his
shoulders are placed <i>ailettes</i> (<span class="smcap">C</span>), or little wings, and these are
ornamented with the same arms as those borne on his shield.
They were worn both for defence and ornament, as soldiers'
epaulettes are now. The defence for the knees (<span class="smcap">G</span>) was made of
leather, and sometimes much ornamented. At a later time it
was made of plated metal. The legs and feet are covered with
chain mail, called the <i>chausse</i> (<span class="smcap">F</span>), and he wears <i>goads</i>, or
'pryck spurs,' on his heels (<span class="smcap">H</span>). Over the hauberk he has
a <i>surcoat</i> (<span class="smcap">E</span>) probably of wool or linen. Here you see it is
quite plain; but it is frequently decorated with heraldic devices;
and such devices on the surcoat or armour are often the only
clue left to the name and history of the wearer.</p>

<p>"On the brasses of <i>civilians</i> we find nothing like the present
ungraceful and unsightly mode of dress; indeed we can scarcely
imagine any thing more ridiculous than the representation of
the modern fashionable dress on a monumental brass. But on
these memorials, you see, the robes are, with rare exceptions,
flowing and graceful. In the sixteenth century there was but
slight difference between the male and female attire of persons
in private life. Of course the dresses of professional men have
always been characteristic. Civilians were, with hardly an
exception, always represented on brasses <i>bare-headed</i>. Happily
for the good people in those times they did not know the
hideous and inconvenient <i>hat</i> which continues to torture those<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>
who live in towns, but from which we in the country have presumed
to free ourselves.</p>

<p>"The dresses <i>actually worn</i> by the deceased are probably
sometimes represented on the brasses of <i>ladies</i>. You have before
you every variety of costume, from the simple robe of the time
of Edward II. and III., down to the extravagant dresses of
Elizabeth's reign. On the early brasses the <i>wimple</i> under the
chin marked the rank of the wearer. Till about the year 1550
ladies are not infrequently represented with heraldic devices
covering their kirtles and mantles; but I should think such
ornamentation was never really worn by them. The different
fashions of wearing the hair here represented are most fantastic.
St. Paul tells us that 'if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to
her;' but these English matrons too often forgot that <i>simplicity</i>
which gives to this beauty of nature its chief charm. See, here
is the <i>butterfly head-dress</i>, of the fifteenth century, extending two
feet at the back of the head; and there is the <i>horn head-dress</i>,
spreading a foot on either side of the head. The fashions
among women then appear to have been as grotesque as they
have been in our own day.</p>

<p>"<i>Children</i> on these tombs are represented either behind or
beneath their parents; sometimes they wear the <i>tabard</i>, a short
coat, with heraldic figures upon it&mdash;as on this brass to John
Ansty; you see there are twelve sons below the father, and four
daughters below the mother&mdash;sometimes they wear a dress which
marks their occupation; and in a few instances the name of each
child is placed below it. <i>Skeletons</i> and emaciated figures, sometimes
in shrouds, were represented on brasses after the fifteenth
century. <i>Crosses</i>, with or without figures of the deceased, are
very frequently to be met with, and their form is often exceedingly
elegant<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. You will not fail to notice the <i>canopies</i> of many
of these brasses; the beauty of some of these designs it would
be impossible to surpass. But I fear you must be tired of my
long lecture, so I must hasten to bring it to a close. These
memorials I like better than any others for churches; for, first,
they are by far the most <i>durable</i> of all; then they are the most
<i>convenient</i>, for they take up little space, and are a great ornament
to the <i>pavement of the church</i>; moreover they teach their<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
own <i>moral</i>, they occupy a <i>lowly</i> place in God's House, and are
all on one <i>common level</i>. I am, therefore, very glad to see them
introduced again into many of our cathedrals and parish
churches. And, my dear Constance, I must end with a word to
you. I fancy by this time you have learnt that <i>monumental
brasses</i> are not dull and stupid. To the student of antiquity,
history, genealogy, heraldry, and architecture, these <i>pavement
monuments</i> are, I assure you, of the greatest interest and value.
They help to fix dates to ancient documents, to illustrate
various periods of ecclesiastical architecture, and throw much
light on the manners and customs of other times. They are,
too, a constant protest against that excess in 'wearing of gold
and putting on of apparel,' against which St. Paul wrote, and
which is one of the great sins of our day; for though we
find elaborate and costly robes represented on the brasses
of the great and the wealthy, you always see the figures of the
humbler classes clothed in neat and simple attire. If people
would only follow the good advice of old Polonius to his
son,</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">M</span>r. Acres and his family
attended Morning
Prayer at St. Catherine's
the day following the Vicar's
lecture; and after service they
examined with greater interest
than ever they had done before
the floor of the church&mdash;indeed
Mr. Acres confessed
that till that morning he had
never had the curiosity to
walk up either of the aisles of
the church with the view of finding any object of interest on the
pavement. In the course of their search they now discovered
a large flat stone, hitherto unknown even to the Vicar; the stone,
when cleansed from the dust which had accumulated upon it (for
it was placed in a remote corner of the church), was very white;
it was engraved with the figure of a priest, and the incised lines
were filled with a black resinous substance, so that it almost
looked like a large engraving on paper, or still more like one of
the copies of brasses which Ernest had exhibited the night
before<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. But what most attracted their attention was the
curious old <i>pavement tiles</i>, of various patterns, which they found
in different parts of the floor of the church. Their admiration
of these ancient works of art was soon so deeply engaged, and
their desire to know more about them so excited, that Ernest
was speedily despatched to the vestry to request the Vicar to
come and satisfy their inquiries.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>"I rejoice to see you, Mr. Vicar," said the Squire, as Mr.
Ambrose approached; "pray come and save me from any
further confessions of ignorance: the children have been persecuting
me with a hundred questions about these ancient tiles,
and I really am not able to answer one of them. We must
again be dependent upon your kindness for some information
on the subject."</p>

<p>"Then, if you please, we will walk and talk, as I must go
this morning to see old Wood, at the Warren Lodge; the poor
man is very ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall enjoy that," exclaimed Constance, "and do,
Mr. Ambrose, give us a nice lecture like you did last night."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, if it is to be a real lecture, we will suppose
this gravel path to be my platform, and your father and yourselves
to be my highly respectable and most intelligent audience;
and so, making my bow to the company, I will begin.&mdash;There is
considerable uncertainty as to the origin of these tiles. Most
people suppose that the old Roman tessellated pavement suggested
the idea of representing figures on tiles. But we may
imagine them to be merely the result of successive improvements.
First, there was the rude tile or brick; then, in very early times,
the makers impressed their own particular marks upon them;
and from this simple practice we can easily imagine the gradual
introduction of the elaborate patterns you were looking at in
the church."</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Ambrose," said Constance, "will you tell
us what was the Roman tessellated pavement?"</p>

<p>"It was composed of a number of square pieces of hard-burnt
clay, like dice, of different colours; these were arranged to form
a pattern, and then firmly fixed in very strong cement. They
were exceedingly durable, and often of most elegant design.
When found in the ruins of Roman villas, which they frequently
are, they generally appear almost as fresh as when they were
put down. Tessellated or mosaic pavements are to be found
in a few old churches; the most beautiful now existing in
England, are in Westminster Abbey, and in Canterbury Cathedral,
near the tomb of Thomas à Becket."</p>

<p>"But don't you think it probable," inquired Mr. Acres, "if
these tiles date pretty nearly back to the time when the mosaic<span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>
pavement was used, that the pavement suggested the tiles?
there seems to be some similarity of pattern, and I noticed that
in one part of the church there are <i>plain</i> tiles of different colours
arranged so as to form a pattern<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, which seems, on a larger scale,
a close imitation of the mosaic pavement."</p>

<p>"It may be so; and this view seems confirmed by the circumstance
that in some foreign churches the tiles are mixed in
the same pavement with mosaic work. It certainly seems a
natural transition from the one to the other.</p>

<p>Encaustic tiles exist in abundance
and great beauty in Normandy;
and though, as I have
said, we cannot fix a precise
date to their introduction, it
seems not improbable that we
are indebted to that country
for the first idea of using them
in the pavement of our
churches, since in some instances
they appear to be coeval
with the erection of the
Norman churches in which they
are found. Some have upon
them the <i>semi-circular headed arch</i>, which is characteristic of
Norman times; and as no doubt the later tiles frequently indicate
by their patterns the period of ecclesiastical architecture
to which they may be referred, most likely these may be equally
relied upon as marking the Norman period. In Ireland, tiles
of this date are more common than in this country. Their
<i>general</i> use, however, has prevailed among us from about A.D.
1250 to A.D. 1550, and the finest and most interesting specimens
we have remaining are at Gloucester and Malvern.</p>

<p>There are several different kinds of ornamental pavement
of which specimens remain. In the ruins of Fountains
Abbey are specimens having the pattern pierced through
the entire tile, and afterwards filled in with clay of another
colour. At Canterbury there are circles of stone pavement<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>
with patterns cut in relief, the spaces being filled in with
dark cement. In the early stages of the art the pattern of the
tiles was sometimes left in relief, the tile being of one colour
only, but the uneven surface was found to be very inconvenient
for walking upon. Encaustic tiles&mdash;so called because the
patterns are <i>burnt into</i> them&mdash;are by far the most common sort
of tile pavement in our English churches, especially in the
southern and western counties."</p>

<p>"I suppose, Mr. Ambrose," said Constance, "that the tiles in
our church are of that sort?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all of them, both the new and old, except the few of a
different kind which Mr. Acres spoke of just now."</p>

<p>"And will you be so kind as to tell us how they contrived to
make those pretty patterns on them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it was a very simple process: very much in the
same way as Bridget makes those pretty pats of butter we
admire so much; quite the same, if Bridget would only fill in
the spaces between the patterns with butter of another colour.
They first made the tile of clay, and then impressed it with a
wooden stamp; then it was dried or burnt, then some thin clay
or cement of another colour (usually white) was poured into the
pattern, then it was glazed over and burnt, the glazing material
making the white a rich yellow, and deepening the colour of the
tile. The pattern is sometimes perfect in a single tile, sometimes
four, eight, or a large number are required to perfect the
design. Several ancient kilns for their manufacture have been
discovered<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. Some of these manufactories, it is evident, were
very popular; for we find that the same kiln sometimes supplied
a great number of churches. Most of our old churches have
at some time been paved with these encaustic tiles; but in
all cases they have in great measure been destroyed or
removed when other beauties of God's house have been defaced,
but often too where the hand of man has spared, the
hand of Time has obliterated.</p>

<p>"We find every variety of pattern upon these tiles. At
Malvern and elsewhere are many letters on single tiles: sometimes
they are alphabetically arranged, sometimes they read<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>
backwards, and sometimes to a centre. Frequently the tiles
have upon them texts of Scripture or other inscriptions, such
as 'The time is short,' 'Wait for the knell.' At Malvern is
a very remarkable tile; it contains the following curious
direction to executors, and was probably intended to be placed
over a tomb:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sacred emblems are very common on encaustic tiles, and especially
symbols of the Passion; within a single shield is sometimes
to be found the cross, crown of thorns, the nails, hammer,
scourge, spear, ladder, dice, vessel for vinegar, sponge on a rod
of hyssop, and rarely, a sort of bill, perhaps representing an
instrument used in removing the Body from the cross. The
cross alone, floriated, is frequently composed of many tiles;
but it enters too into the great majority of those geometrical
and floriated patterns which form so large a portion of the
encaustic pavements of most churches. Armorial bearings and
mottoes of benefactors, founders, and others are frequently met
with. At Great Bedwyn, and in the ruins of Chertsey Abbey,
have been found knights in armour and other most interesting
figures, throwing considerable light on the history of the armour
and costumes of the period. At Westminster are figures of a
king, queen, and abbot, which are supposed to represent King
Henry III., his Queen, and the Abbot of Westminster. Then
I have often seen the cock, the emblem of vigilance; the fox,
the emblem of subtlety; the pelican, of piety."</p>

<p>"Why," quietly inquired Ernest, "is the pelican an emblem
of piety?"<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>"There is an old legend which tells us that the young of a
pelican were once saved from death by starvation by the parent
bird tearing open her breast and feeding them with her own
blood. This has from very early times been considered a very
beautiful emblem of that Sacrifice which has been offered by
Jesus Christ to save us from eternal death. Other emblems
are&mdash;the circle, of eternity; the <i>fleur de lis</i>, of the Blessed
Virgin; the triangle, of the Trinity; the fish, of the Second
Person of the Trinity."</p>

<p>"Now do tell me what that means, please, Mr. Ambrose,"
said Constance; "I cannot see why the fish should be so sacred
an emblem."</p>

<p>"As you don't understand Greek, my dear, it is not a matter
of surprise that you have not understood this oft-recurring
emblem. You must know that the Greek word for fish is
ἱχθὑς [ichthys], and the letters in this word form the first letters of
each word of a Greek sentence, of which this is the English
translation:&mdash;'Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour;'
hence the employment of this sacred symbol. Other devices
are stags, hounds, antelopes, and other animals; swans,
and other birds; emblems of trades, &amp;c. Some appear ludicrous
to us, though no doubt many of them were originally intended
to teach some useful lesson. At Little Marlow is a fool's head,
or cock's comb; at Godmersham, on several tiles is a bending
old man, with a staff in his hand, and on his head a fool's cap,
representing age and folly. It would seem, however, that some
of these grotesque figures were manufactured for no very useful
purpose, as is evidenced by the penance once inflicted on a
monk of Normandy for making tiles of this description<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Encaustic
tiles have sometimes been used for memorials of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>
departed<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. In the ruins of Evesham Abbey, <i>under</i> a stone
coffin, was found a pavement of tiles, on which were initials
and a cross. <i>Above</i> a stone coffin, in the ruins of Kirkstall
Abbey, was found, in 1713, a pavement of similar tiles; in
Gloucester Cathedral is a tile to the memory of John Hertford;
and at Monmouth one to Thomas Coke and Alice his wife.
These works of art are not only to be admired as the most
suitable decorations for the floors of God's house; they are
also interesting as specimens of art at various periods; frequently
they throw light on the history of churches and religious
foundations, and occasionally also of private families. I rejoice
to see them again claiming the attention of modern
artists and manufacturers, and finding a place once more in
the churches, which on all sides are happily being restored to
their former beauty and appropriateness.&mdash;But here we are at
Wood's cottage."</p>

<h2>THE WALLS</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">T</span>he Warren Lodge was one of those pretty little cottages
which are often to be found nestling in bright, peaceful
corners, about the parks and estates of such wealthy squires as
Mr. Acres; men whose kindliness of heart and whose refinement
of taste induce them to combine the picturesque with
the comfortable, in the houses they provide for their tenants
and retainers. It was built very near to the Warren Gate of the
park, and old Wood had been placed here because, being a spot
little frequented, it was a quiet resting-place for him in his old
age. Opposite the cottage was a lovely glen, where yew-trees
and laurels, mingling with oaks and beeches, hung in
many beautiful and fantastic forms over a greensward which
all the year round never lost its verdure or its softness.
Seldom did old Master Wood and his wife wander farther from
their cottage than the end of this quiet glen; but that was their
daily walk, and Mr. Acres had put up two rustic seats for them
to rest upon, so that the old couple might accomplish their daily
journey without any great fatigue. But the old man was now
too weak for this.</p>

<p>"I think you and the children had better go in, and leave me
outside," said Mr. Acres, "as possibly poor Wood may feel more
at his ease if I am not present."</p>

<p>So Mr. Ambrose and the three children entered the cottage.
It was, as always, the picture of neatness and cleanliness;
there were a few well-tended geraniums in the windows, and
some nice pictures on the walls&mdash;not the gaudy, vulgar prints
which are so commonly found in the cottages of the poor, but
really good and well-coloured engravings of sacred subjects&mdash;a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>
supply of which Mr. Ambrose always kept on sale at a very low
price<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. There was enough of neat furniture in the rooms; and
on a nice bed, with snow-white drapery, lay the poor old man.
After a short conversation Mr. Ambrose read the twelfth chapter
of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and then, when he had
given a short explanation of the chapter, all knelt down whilst
he said some collects from the Office of the Visitation of the
Sick, and a prayer applicable to the special circumstances of
these humble cottagers.</p>

<p>The prayers ended, the old man rose up in his bed, and said,
"Ah, sir, I have often thought of that chapter you read just
now, when I was able to go to our dear old church. Just
opposite my seat, you know, was the picture on the wall of the
man giving a poor thirsting creature a cup of water, and of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>
another giving a loaf of bread to somebody that looked very
hungry. When Mr. Greekhurst was at our church, years ago,
you know, sir, he used to preach very learned sermons, and we
poor people couldn't understand much about them, but there
was my text and sermon too, straight before me, and I always
remembered the picture if I didn't remember the sermon. I
really think that looking on the old picture made me somehow
more kindly disposed to some of my neighbours. I suppose it
has been there a great many years, sir?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<a name="image123" id="image123"></a>
<img src="images/illus123.jpg" width="351" height="235" alt=" Ancient Wall Paintings in Kimpton Church" title="">
</div>

<p>"Yes, my friend; I should think about five hundred years."</p>

<p>"So long as that! Well then, I hope it has taught a good
lesson to many before me."</p>

<p>"No doubt it has; and though it is now almost worn away
from the wall, you will be glad to know that we have the same
subject in the new painted window close by, so the old sermon
will not be lost."</p>

<p>"'Tis strange, sir, how well one remembers pictures of this
sort, and how they make one think about things which, but
for them, we certainly might not care to inquire much about.
Now when I was a young man I never thought a great deal of
that beautiful chapter where St. Paul says so much about charity.
I had often heard the chapter read, and sometimes read it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>
myself, but still it never came to my mind how necessary a
thing charity was for us to have, till one day I went to Sunday-morning
service at an old church near our home. I got to the
church some time before service, so I walked about the churchyard,
and looked round the church, and there were pictures all
round the outside of the walls of the church<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, explaining that
chapter. There was one man bringing all his riches, and every
thing he had, to give to the poor, and there was another poor
man being burnt to death, and so on; and then at the last it
said that, without love to God and man, all this was good for
nothing. Now, sir, I don't recollect a single word of hundreds
of sermons I have heard, but I shall never forget those
pictures."</p>

<p>"Very likely, for most of us remember better what we <i>see</i>
than what we <i>hear</i>, and it is a great mistake not to teach people
through the <i>eye</i> as well as the ear. But we must say good-bye,
as Mr. Acres is waiting for us in the park. God bless you, and,
if it is His will, I hope you may yet be strong enough to enjoy
many of your old walks."</p>

<p>On their return home they followed a path which led them
again through the churchyard of St. Catherine's, and were soon
joined by the Squire, whose patience had been somewhat exhausted
by the long stay of the little party at old Wood's
cottage.</p>

<h2>THE WALLS</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">M</span>r. Dole, the proprietor of the village emporium,
where all sorts of inferior wares were to be had at the
highest obtainable prices, was one of those persons who seem
sent into the world for the special purpose of preventing others
from being too happy in it. There are persons, no doubt, who
go through life always frowning upon their fellow-creatures, ever
throwing a dark shadow along the path before them; people
who persistently turn their backs upon the sunny side of human
life; who seem to think it wicked to take a bright and cheerful
view of any thing or any body on all God's earth; whose
whole countenances would be utterly revolutionized by the
faintest approach to an honest, friendly smile. Such persons,
we must believe, are often very sincere, and are endeavouring
to do good in their own way; nor must we say that they
always fail in their endeavour; nevertheless they are not the
sort of persons we care to have as our frequent companions.
It is true, there is enough about the lives of most of us to
make us often sorrowful; but no less true is it, that the man
who, leading a Christian life and doing God's work in the world,
preserves "a conscience void of offence to wards God and to wards
men" will take care that his outward demeanour does not make
his religion unlovely and repulsive in the sight of others. Mr.
Dole being of the class we have described, it was no wonder that
the village lads had honoured his name with an affix, and that
he was generally known among them as old Doleful; nor shall
we be surprised that his appearance in the churchyard just as
Mr. Acres and the Vicar entered it was not welcomed by them
with any excessive pleasure.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Dole," said both gentlemen, as they
approached him. But there was no responsive "Good evening"
from Mr. Dole. Now it is always a bad sign when a man will<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>
not return such a simple salutation as that: I never knew but one
who made me no answer when I wished him "Good evening;"
I was at once impressed with the idea that there was little good
in him, and my impression was correct, for in a few moments
after the fellow had put a light to the thatched house of a poor
neighbour who had offended him, and very soon the poor man's
house and goods were crackling in a mass of flame. But, it
must be confessed, Mr. Dole withheld his salutation from no
such motive as influenced this man. There was something
far too pleasant and cheerful about a kindly "Good evening"
to harmonize in any way with the tone of Mr. Dole's voice or
manner; but beyond this, he never said "Good morning" or
"Good evening" to any one <i>on principle</i>. The fact is, Mr. Dole belonged
to a portion of the sect of Anabaptists called "Calvinist
Baptists," and the extreme Calvinistic feature of his Creed had
become with him quite a monomania. The idea of <i>predestination</i>
haunted him every where and in every thing; it ran through
his whole life of thought, word, and action; with it he justified
all his own shortcomings, and it made him insensible to the right
motives and doings of others. He had become so accustomed
to look on the dark side of men and things, that he had gained
for himself a settled character of gloominess and suspicion, and
had quite lost sight of the Apostolic precept&mdash;"Be courteous."
Thus he did not believe that these two gentlemen meant what
they said, and <i>really wished</i> him to have a "Good evening;"
and, as regarded himself, he would have considered the words
as a flying in the face of Providence, a direful offence against
the phantom idol of inevitable Predestination which he had set
up in his own heart. To him it seemed only a mockery
to use those words of common courtesy, when&mdash;as he said
to himself&mdash;it was already ordained whether these persons
should have a good or a bad evening, and no words of his
could affect or alter their destiny. And so he simply said,
"How do you do, gentlemen?" But it was spoken in a
deep, sepulchral voice, as though he reserved to himself a
mental protest against even this small conformity to the
world's civility.</p>

<p>"People are talking about the painting you have been doing
in the church, Mr. Ambrose, and I have just come up to look at<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>
it; not that I like that sort of thing, and I don't think the
parish money should be spent in that way."</p>

<p>"You need not be at all anxious on that score, Mr. Dole, as
my friend here has defrayed the whole cost of the work; but let
us go into the church together."</p>

<p>Now the line of thought which this man had so long adopted,
and the <i>one idea</i> he had cherished, had so dulled his heart and
mind to all sense of the beautiful that he could never appreciate,
like other people, what was pure and lovely, either in nature or
in art. No wonder then that he failed to admire the beautiful
decoration with which the Squire had adorned St. Catherine's
Church.</p>

<p>First of all, Mr. Ambrose pointed out to him some old wall-paintings
of great interest, which had been recently discovered.
From these Mr. Acres had had the successive coats of whitewash
carefully removed, and, though they were several centuries old,
the colours were but little faded. Among the most curious
were a series of paintings which quite covered the north wall of
the chancel.</p>

<p>"You will see, Mr. Dole, that these all represent events
in the life of our Blessed Lord. Here is the beginning of
the series; it is the Tree of Jesse, showing the descent of
our Lord in the line of David,&mdash;next is the Nativity,&mdash;next
the Adoration of the Magi,&mdash;then, the Massacre of the Holy
Innocents,&mdash;then, the Presentation in the temple; and there,
on the upper part of the wall, are&mdash;the Betrayal, our Lord
before Pilate, being Mocked, being Scourged, bearing His
Cross, His Crucifixion, and there, below the Crucifixion, His
descent from the Cross, and His Entombment<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. These, you
see, Mr. Dole, are not only valuable as showing one way
in which our Church five hundred years ago set before the
eyes and minds of the people the human life of our Lord; but
they are still well suited for the sacred place they adorn,
inasmuch as they still serve to remind the worshipper in this
House of Prayer of the great truths they represent. I must,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>
however, confess that we brought to light some paintings on
the walls of a different character; some of these were very
grotesque, others were from some cause or other objectionable.
These were copied, as possessing antiquarian interest, and were
then obliterated. It was long before we could bring our minds
to destroy these curious relics of old days<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, and had they<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>
occupied less conspicuous places in the church, I think we
should have been tempted to preserve them, but the House of
God has a higher use than to be a mere preserver of curiosities,
and to this higher use its decorations and all within it should
contribute."</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Ambrose then explained the new wall-decorations which
had been painted by Mr. Acres. These consisted of groups
illustrating sacred subjects, texts of Holy Scripture mixed
with foliage and tracery; and, by clever introduction of foliage
and holy texts among the old work, he had made the old and
the new to harmonize very well. The colours were well
arranged, and all was done with a due reference to the architectural
features of the church. Before this time the only
attempt at ornament for the walls of the church consisted
of some square boards, put up about fifty years ago, on which
were painted some ill-selected sentences, whilst beneath each
sentence was painted a human head of inhuman ugliness.</p>

<p>Not one word had as yet been spoken to the Vicar by his
seemingly attentive listener. At length he said, in his usual
dismal tone, "I don't see any use in it, sir. To my mind, our
little Rehoboth down in the village is more like the simplicity
of the Gospel. Besides, I call all this a breaking of the second
commandment."</p>

<p>"I leave you to judge whether the mean little meeting-house
you call Rehoboth, or this beautiful church, is most in accordance
with the only patterns we have in God's Word of houses dedicated
to His worship, or most fitting as types of the Heavenly
Temple whose magnificence is described in such glowing language
by St. John; but as regards these paintings, the pictures
and toys you sell in your shop are just as much a breaking of
the second commandment; for these are no more made to
worship than are those."</p>

<p>"But nobody will kneel down before my toys and pictures;
if they kneel at all, however, in your church, they must kneel
before these pictures. I call them idolatrous images, and I say
they are worshipped."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>"And, by the same mode of reasoning, I say, Mr. Dole, that
the people at your meeting-house break the second commandment;
for they fall down to whitewash, and worship it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, only this: that turn whichever way they will to
worship, they must turn to one of your four whitewashed walls.
But let us be quite fair to each other. The truth is, you don't
worship whitewash, nor do we worship images; but whilst we
think it most in accordance with reason and religion to decorate
our walls with sacred subjects, such as are likely to suggest
solemn and holy thoughts, and to make our churches as beautiful
as possible, you, on the contrary, seem to regard it as a
religious duty to make your meeting-houses as ugly as possible.
And now I must say good-bye, Mr. Dole."</p>

<p>"Sir, I should like to meet you here again some day."</p>

<p>"I only wish we could at least meet here every Sunday.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>"I almost think," said Mr. Acres, as they left the church,
"the outside of our church walls are as interesting as their
interior. The north wall is evidently the earliest part of the
church. It contains some Roman bricks, placed herring-bone
fashion, among the old Norman rubble. This, doubtless, was
erected immediately after the destruction of the little Saxon
church with its wooden walls<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> which once stood on this very
site; then come the Early English walls of the chancel, then
the very interesting specimens of brick-work of the sixteenth
century in the tower and western walls. But you have given
Mr. Dole and us all such a long and useful lecture on the <i>inside</i>
of the walls, that we must not stop to say any more about their
outside."</p>

<p>"I must just say this, my friend, respecting the outside walls,
that I can forgive a builder for any fault more easily than for
want of <i>reality</i> in the exterior of a church. For the sake of
decoration and neatness it may be desirable that the internal
walls should be covered with cement or plaster, but there is no
excuse for so covering the church externally. If mean materials<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>
are used, let the mean materials appear; but it is unpardonable
to use the mean and spread over it a false pretence of
the costly. Brick walls are often very beautiful, and not
inferior to flint or stone; but if they are of brick, let the brick
be seen, and let it not pretend to be <i>stone</i>."</p>

<h2>THE WINDOWS</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">M</span>r. Acres and his family had now learnt, from their
many conversations with the Vicar on the subject,
to take a deep interest in church architecture, and were ever
seeking and finding some new beauties either in the solid
building or the ornaments of their own ancient church, which
now they looked upon with quite a new feeling of pride and
admiration. When, therefore, Mr. Ambrose was a visitor at the
Hall, he was not unfrequently called upon to deliver a short
drawing-room lecture on some portion of the church or its
furniture. "Now, Mr. Ambrose," said the Squire, on one of
these occasions, "as we are only a family party this evening,
will you kindly give us some more information on our favourite
topic of conversation lately? I see the same request is on the
lips of all these little people, but they are not so impudent,
I suppose, as I am. You will, I hope, find us more profitable
pupils than Mr. Dole, to whom you specially addressed your
lecture in the church the other day."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that; for what I said to him, if it did
no more, at least set him <i>thinking</i>; and that is a great point,
you know. You see, those kind of people, as a rule, never read
and never hear any thing really worth reading or hearing about
matters of this sort. They are simply taught to believe that all
outward form and ceremony in the Services, and all outward
<i>meaning</i> and <i>beauty</i> in the fabric of the church, are idolatrous
and superstitious, and they care to inquire no further than that.
Their prejudice is fostered by ignorance, and to lead them to
<i>inquire</i> is the first step to wards inducing conviction. Then,
how very little our own people generally know about these
things, and how seldom comparatively they are prepared with a
ready answer with which to meet the objections of persons who
are even more ignorant than themselves! This surely ought not
to be. If we place beautiful and costly ornaments and furniture
in our churches, the poorest person in the parish should be<span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>
taught the meaning of them; and if the Stones of the Temple
have each a lesson to teach, the poorest person in the parish
ought to know what they say. But I am wandering from my
point: our last subject was the <i>walls</i> of the church; what shall
we talk about to-day, Constance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think the <i>windows</i> should come next, Mr. Ambrose;
but there are so many different kinds of windows, that, of course,
you cannot tell us all that might be said about them."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, my dear; I can only tell you a very small part
of their history, but still enough, perhaps, to increase the
interest you already feel on the subject. First, then, I shall say
something about the <i>stone-work</i> of the windows; and what I
say about windows applies very much also to the <i>doors</i> of a
church, only the doors are generally much more richly ornamented.
Now there are some very simple rules by which we
may commonly know from the windows pretty nearly at what
period that particular part of the church was built. You cannot,
of course, always tell from any thing still existing at what
time the church was <i>first</i> built, because often no part whatever
of the first church is remaining. The font, from its sheltered
position, is the most frequently preserved relic of the original
church; sometimes one doorway alone remains, and sometimes
but a single window to mark the earliest date of the church.</p>

<p>"As I must not puzzle your brains with the hard words
employed by persons learned in church building, I do not
profess to give you the nice distinctions by which they arrive
almost at exact dates. Ours must be a very rapid glance at the
whole subject. The two great distinct characters, then, in church
windows, as also in other parts of the building, are the <i>semi-circular
arch</i> and the <i>pointed arch</i>. The former is to be found
in churches erected before the year 1150, and the latter since
that year; but of course there are exceptions. The earliest
round-headed windows (that the few buildings in which they are
found were originally intended as Christian temples, I do not
of course affirm) are the <i>Roman</i>, and these are easily known,
for they are nearly always partly composed of red bricks<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. Then<span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>
come the <i>Saxon</i>; these are built of stone, but are quite plain,
and generally as rude and rough as the Roman. You know the
Romans held possession of our country from the year 50 before
Christ till A.D. 450; and then the Saxons held the country till
A.D. 1066; but it is impossible accurately to fix the dates of
most of the churches they built. Next follow the <i>Norman</i>;
these are more ornamental, and not so roughly executed; and
after the Norman Conquest, when many clever builders and
masons came over from Normandy, they were often most
beautifully decorated. The figures of persons and animals,
indeed, that are sometimes to be found (but more especially
above the doorways) at this time seem very quaint and curious
to us now, and often quite unintelligible, but no doubt they
once all had an useful meaning and were specimens of the
highest art of the time; very many of them are Scripture
subjects. Sometimes triangular windows are to be met with of
the Saxon and Norman periods, but very rarely. As I said
before, some of their stone carvings appear to us to be very
quaint and grotesque, and so too the arrangement of their
windows was sometimes fanciful; they seem to have attempted
occasionally<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, to represent the features of the face, the doorway
representing the mouth, and the windows the eyes and nose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">
<a name="image145" id="image145"></a>
<img src="images/illus145.jpg" width="399" height="299" alt="Crowmarsh Church" title="">
</div>

<p>"The reason why the windows were in some instances so
small, we may imagine was because they were sometimes not<span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>
glazed, and it was desirable that, to keep out the wind and rain
and the winter's cold, they should be only just large enough to
admit the necessary light. I have lately seen an old Norman
window which had been long bricked up, in which there had
evidently never been any glass<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. We need not be surprised at
this, for even so lately as in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it
was no uncommon thing for the windows in private houses to
have no glass in them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 144px;">
<img src="images/illus146.jpg" width="144" height="77" alt="Arches diagram" title="">
</div><p>"Now we come to the pointed-headed arches. From about
A.D. 1150 to A.D. 1200, which is called the <i>Transition</i> period
the two styles were a good deal mixed. People have different,
opinions as to the origin of these pointed arches. A learned
friend of mine has an idea of his own about it, which he calls
<i>the finger theory</i>. He supposes that all church arches and tracery
may be derived from different positions in which the fingers
may be placed when the hands are clasped as in prayer, and that
from these, first the round, and then the pointed arch was suggested
as a fit design to be adopted for a House of Prayer. It
is at least an ingenious and a pleasing conception. Some have
imagined that the meeting of branches in a grove of trees
first gave the idea of the pointed arch. Often, as I have
looked down the avenue by old Wood's cottage, has the
opening at the opposite end reminded me of the eastern
window of some splendid cathedral, whilst the long intervening
rows of trees, with their branches uniting overhead, has suggested
to my mind the pillars and groined roof of the building.
Our old heathen forefathers knew well the grand effect of
these magnificent temples of nature's building, when they
selected them as the places best adapted for their awful
sacrifices, and the worship of their
'Unknown God<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.' But it seems
most probable that one style of
architecture naturally introduced
another, and that the pointed
followed naturally from the semi-circular
arch. When the builders
saw what a beautiful arch was produced by a number of their<span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>
old semi-circular arches intersecting each other, they gradually
introduced the newly-discovered pointed arch, and at length,
finding that it admitted of such a far greater variety of beautiful
tracery in the window, they abandoned the old style
altogether.</p>


<p>"The first pure style of pointed windows is called the <i>Early
English</i><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, which prevailed from about A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1300.
It is often very simple, the plain lancet-shaped window being
the most common; it frequently has the same ornaments as
the Norman, but its peculiar ornament is a flower, almost
round, called the <i>ball-flower</i>. This was followed, up to about
A.D. 1400, by a more graceful flowing style, called the <i>Decorated</i>
or <i>Florid</i>, and it is chiefly to be distinguished by the
waving flame-like character of the stone-work in the upper
part of the window. Then next we have quite a different
style, which is called the <i>Perpendicular</i>, so named from its
upright or perpendicular lines, some of which run up uninterruptedly
from the bottom to the top of the window. This
style is peculiar to England, and windows of this character
are very rarely to be found elsewhere. In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, the arch of the window gradually becomes
depressed, first sinking to the <i>Tudor</i> arch, and then losing its
pointed character altogether and becoming quite flat; and
this introduced what, from its comparative want of beauty, is
called the <i>Debased</i> style. The windows of this period were
usually square-headed, and possessed, like the other parts of
the building, little ornament. It prevailed till the middle of
the seventeenth century, and may be considered the second
childhood of Church Architecture; and it was certainly far
inferior to the first. Succeeding to this period came all those
hideous semi-classical erections, most of which, I believe, were
built in the reign of Queen Anne, though some were before and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>
some after; and those still more unsightly parodies on Gothic
architecture which were erected at the close of the last and
commencement of the present century. In our own day we
have far <i>advanced</i> by a complete <i>retrogression</i>, and churches
are mostly copies of one or other of the styles I have mentioned.
If, however, our present age may boast of a church
architecture of its own, it will undoubtedly be that of those
most beautiful <i>brick</i> churches which have been but lately
erected, such as All Saints' and St. Alban's, London, and
St. James', Oxford."</p>

<p>"You have not told us any thing about the <i>round</i> windows,
Mr. Ambrose," said Constance; "you know we have a very
pretty one in our church."</p>

<p>"Yes, I ought to have told you that these circular windows
are to be found in all styles of architecture, usually at the west
end of the church. They are called rose windows and marigold
windows, from their supposed likeness to those flowers;
and St. Catherine's windows, from their resemblance to the
wheel on which she suffered martyrdom. It is likely that this
window was placed in our church because it is dedicated to
St. Catherine."</p>

<p>"That leads me to ask," said Mr. Acres, "what <i>symbolism</i>
there may be in the windows of a church; for in your sermon
last Sunday you said that there was a lesson to be learnt from
all the speechless stones of the sanctuary."</p>

<p>"Yes; and every window in the church should remind us
of certain Christian truths. The <i>light</i> which they admit
should make us think of Him who is the 'Light of the world,'
'a Light to lighten the Gentiles,' 'the Day-spring from on
high,' 'the Sun of Righteousness,' 'that lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.' The window with its double
compartments reminds us of the two natures of Christ; the
triple window, and the many triple forms in it, of the Trinity<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>
But it is of course most chiefly in its storied panes that the
church window becomes our teacher."</p>

<p>"Certainly; I see that: and, by-the-by, as I am as ignorant
as my children about the history of stained glass, please
tell us something about that before we part."</p>

<p>"I will, gladly. As far as we know, stained glass was never
used before about the year 850; but when it once came into
general use, it would appear that no church was considered
complete unless every window was furnished with it. At
first, it probably consisted of rude imitations of old mosaic
patterns<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Then figures were introduced, which depended for
their general effect upon broad black lines either produced by
lead or colour. The old stained glass may always be known
by the deep richness of its colours, especially of the blue and
ruby. Probably Canterbury Cathedral possesses the earliest
and best specimens remaining, the date of some of which is
about A.D. 1120<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. In the glass of this time you find small
medallions containing several figures, the surrounding parts
being filled with tracery. Next come small single figures, or
groups of figures, with or without canopies, with border
tracery and foliage; sometimes there are the shields of
founders and benefactors. About A.D. 1350 larger figures of
saints were painted, each occupying a whole compartment of
the window, with larger and more elaborate canopies. Now,
too, windows began to be <i>mortuary</i>, and contained figures of
deceased persons, with their shields and banners. In the following
century single subjects often extended over several<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>
compartments, or even the whole of the window. Sentences
in old English letters were frequently painted, issuing from the
mouths of figures (just as we find them on monumental brasses
of the same date), and also in various other parts of the
window. One colour only, commonly yellow, with black lines
to mark the features and dresses, was now, and also before
this time, frequently used.</p>

<p>"At this period glass painters fell into a great error by
studying more to paint pictures, correct in all the lesser and
unimportant parts of the drawing, than to produce a pleasing
and solemn distant effect; they often lost the effect of a grand
accessory to the beauty and harmony of a Gothic temple, in
order to gain that of a piece of painted calico. From about
A.D. 1600 this art gradually declined, and, with some exceptions,
the glass painting and architecture of our churches fell
together, the inferior artist of the former being often employed
in depicting the debased style of the latter. Immense quantities
of stained glass were destroyed by the sacrilegious hands
of the Puritans in the seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, and of course
much, from its brittle nature, has otherwise perished; enough,
however, remains to show how splendidly our churches were
formerly decorated with it, and to afford invaluable aid to
those who are now engaged in promoting the happy revival of
this noble art.</p>

<p>"There is just one other point to which I must briefly allude&mdash;the
value of stained glass windows as <i>historical records</i>.
There can be no objection to windows in some parts of the
church (specially those placed over the arches of the nave
which are called <i>clerestory</i> windows) being thus employed,
though the presence of these subjects in some parts would be
most objectionable. There are some most interesting windows
of this character still remaining. I have only time to notice
some of those in Great Malvern Church. I have brought you
some drawings of these windows; they represent some events
in the life of St. Werstan, who was martyred in a small chapel<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>
near to the spot where these windows are. This glass preserves
the only ancient record we have of this saint. In the first pane
you see there is a representation of Werstan himself; the hills
at the back, with the flowers and ferns upon them, probably
represent the Malvern hills; and the painting above, the plot
of ground on which his church was built. The key has reference
either to the material fabric or the spiritual efficacy of
its sacred services, and the four corner-stones, held by four
angels, each with three fingers raised in the attitude of blessing
in the name of the Trinity, are doubtless intended to indicate
the favour of Heaven on his pious work. In the next pane
the figure and hills are repeated, and above is a representation
of the different ceremonies attending the consecration of the
completed church. In the third pane you see the hills, with
their flowers and ferns, covering the whole background; in the
lower part, the now regular services of St. Werstan's little
church appear to be represented by three choristers; and
standing near them are two persons who are probably their
instructors. The upper part represents the martyrdom of the
saint in his own chapel. The stained glass in Great Malvern
Church contains other historical records, but we have not time
to notice them."</p>

<h2>A LOOSE STONE IN THE BUILDING</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>

<h2>A DIGRESSION</h2>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">S</span>ince the last conversation which we recorded between
the Vicar and Mr. Dole, the character of the latter had
become much softened. On various occasions they had been
brought into each other's company, and the consequence was
that each had begun to think more favourably of the other,
and to find some unsuspected good qualities which promised
well to establish between them that cordial good feeling and
mutual respect which ought always to exist between a Pastor
and each member of his flock.</p>

<p>The following close of a long conversation might explain
the loss of esteem and influence which many a parish priest,
besides the Vicar of St. Catherine's, has had to deplore:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Ambrose, had we known each other more, we
should have understood each other better; my lips, at least,
would have been saved the guilt of many hard words;
perhaps, too, sir, you would have thought of me a little more
charitably."</p>

<p>"There may be truth in that, Mr. Dole," said the Vicar;
"but then you must own that you have always shown such
sternness and severity to wards me as to forbid any friendly
approach on my part. I have, indeed, put it down, in a great
measure, to that harsh judgment of the conduct and opinions
of others which I considered your form of dissent tended to
foster&mdash;but this has not relieved me of my difficulty."</p>

<p>"I suppose I must confess that those who hold very strictly
to the doctrines in which I have been brought up, have generally
a severe and sour bearing to wards others who do not<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>
believe as they do, and, indeed, very often to wards members
of their own body also. Then, you see, sir, at their
prayer meetings, and their Sabbath services, they get much
more excited and animated than people do at church, and so,
perhaps, it's natural for them to be a little more subdued and
less lively when they are out of 'meeting.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's natural; and no doubt what you say accounts
for some differences in the opinions we form of each other's
characters. At 'meeting' I am aware persons are commonly
wrought up, by exciting appeals, loud words, and wild gestures,
to a state of <i>high pressure</i>, of which we at church know little;
and so they consider the calm, dignified solemnity of our
services as cold and lifeless. Out of 'meeting' a reaction
takes place, and they become comparatively depressed and
undemonstrative, and we consider them morose and ill-tempered;
<i>we</i> have no such reaction to undergo, and to us the
world seems brighter than to them, and so they think us
frivolous and worldly. But for my part, Mr. Dole, I can't
possibly see what is the use of a man's speaking ten times
louder than is necessary in order to make himself heard, just
that he may produce a fever-heat in the pulses of his congregation.
If continued for any length of time, it leads to something
very like temporary madness; if not, it is likely to subside
into a dull, sullen apathy. Moreover, I have yet to learn
that it is wrong, provided we do not abuse them, to enjoy
the good things God gives us, with a <i>cheerful countenance</i>&mdash;aye,
and with a merry heart, too.</p>

<p>"On that point I have for some time been inclining to your
opinion, sir; though, I fear, you will think I have not given
much outward proof of it. But, nevertheless, you have in this
matter as yet partly mistaken me&mdash;indeed we have partly
mistaken each other. Perhaps my religion may, in some
degree, account for my seeming gloominess and indifference;
but these have arisen quite as much from home sorrows and
disappointments, and the coldness and cruelty I have experienced
from others. I will not, however, trouble you with
these matters now, more than to say, that if you could have
overlooked the ungracious words I may sometimes have said
to and of you, and have looked in upon me, and for my evil<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>
have returned good, by speaking some kind and friendly words
to me, you would have done much to brighten a life that has
known but little sunshine; for I have longed more than I can
tell you for a friend to whom I could fearlessly tell the
sorrows of my heart. I know I have been to blame, for I
always used to think you too <i>proud</i> to take much interest in
my cares and troubles; may be, sir&mdash;I am sure you will
forgive my plain speaking&mdash;may be we have been both a little
to blame.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Ambrose," continued his parishioner, in a far
more cheerful voice than was usual with him, "you know that
since your friendly conversation with me that day in the
church, I have followed the advice you then gave me, and
have never failed to be one of your congregation at least once
on the Sunday. I trust I have profited by what you have
taught me: will you not be offended if I for a moment turn
the tables, and preach a few words to you? I don't mean to
<i>you</i> yourself personally, sir, but I mean to you as one of the
ministers of the Church."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will not say any thing that will give me
just cause for offence, my friend, and so I promise not to be
offended."</p>

<p>"Well then, sir, you know I have always lived amongst
Dissenters, so I know pretty well who and what they are. You
will agree with me, that there are many excellent people
among them, and there are some learned people among them;
but generally they have but little learning. Very often their
attention has been almost solely directed to <i>a single point of
doctrine</i> which itself forms the ground of their dissent from the
Church&mdash;just as with me; though I do not think the Church
is quite right on some other matters, yet I should not separate
from it could I be persuaded that the Church was right about
<i>Baptism</i>. That has always been <i>my one</i> great stumbling-block.
But I think, sir, speaking with all respect for yourself, that
there is <i>one great cause</i> in the Church ministers themselves
which has kept the Dissenters from coming back to the
Church. I know that this has more to do with the <i>past</i> than
the <i>present</i>; I know too that it could not of itself justify any
one in separating from the Church. But, sir, look at the class of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>
people Dissenters are of, in this country; their whole strength
lies in the middle and the small-trade class. There are among
them comparatively very few rich and educated, very few poor.
You will say the love of the power and position which those
people obtain for themselves in the meeting-house, but which
they could not possess, in the same way, in the Church,
naturally draws them to the Dissenters. That is no doubt
partly true; giving them also credit&mdash;as I am sure you do,
sir&mdash;for higher motives. But I see another reason; and that
is, the wide difference between the Church ministers and the
people."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," said the Vicar: "the difference in
their social position. I admit that the social position of the
dissenting preacher is more on a level with that class of which,
as you say, Dissenters are chiefly composed than is that of the
Clergy. But then, Mr. Dole, the Church does not only retain
its hold on the upper and the educated classes, but
also on the poor (of course I speak generally; for there are,
alas! a large number of these which are beyond the reach of
any religious ministrations whatever)."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, sir, that's the very point. I think in times past
the Church ministers have stood too much on their social and
worldly dignity: they have made too much of the <i>man</i>, and
too little of the <i>office</i>. It's different now almost every where.
But you see, sir, this just separated them from the tradespeople,
but it didn't separate them from the poor. They
didn't feel their pride wounded when they took the horny
hand of the labourer; but it was a greater trial of humility to
shake hands with the tradesman over the counter, and to go
and sit down in the parlour behind the shop, in the same
friendly way in which they visited the poor cottagers. Then,
you know, sir, there were many other ways in which this class
was neglected: <i>we</i> think it was lest too great attention should
lead to too great familiarity. The wealth and education of
a tradesman perhaps sometimes made his social position
border too closely on that of the Church minister, and
perhaps the minister felt it his duty carefully to guard the
narrow barrier; but, oh, dear me, sir, what is all that compared
with the work God has given him to do! I don't think that<span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>
one who has the salvation of his people at heart will stop to
consider whether a friendly, faithful pastoral visit may or may
not result in a more familiar nod from his parishioners for the
future. Do you know, sir, I think this is one of the loose
stones in your spiritual House."</p>

<p>"I agree with much that you have said, as regards <i>past
years</i>: but you must not put all down to <i>pride</i>; you must
make more allowances for men's peculiar habits, and circumstances,
and manners. Only just now you excused a kindred
fault in yourself on the ground of private cares and anxieties.
However, our views on this matter are not far apart. I consider,
with you, that a clergyman's <i>office</i> overrides all social
distinctions; and that he should be equally at home at the
squire's mansion, the tradesman's parlour, and the meanest
cottage in his parish; none should be too high for his familiarity,
none too low for his friendship: as Chaucer says,
'the beggar is his brother.' His <i>social</i> position is certainly as
nothing compared with his <i>official</i>, and should always be made
subservient to it. I cannot understand how any clergyman,
who rightly estimates the high dignity of his sacred office
as a priest, can take a different view from this. However&mdash;God
be praised!&mdash;times are altered in this respect: the
Clergy have thrown away almost every where that reserve
which no doubt lost to the Church many of the class which
the Dissenters have gained. And we see now the good
results; for in thousands of parishes the sons and daughters
of these very people are working hand-in-hand with their
Pastor, and are among the most zealous and faithful children
of the Church, bringing again within the walls of her Temples
multitudes of those who have been fellow-wanderers with
themselves, and so helping to repair, one by one, the many
breaches which have, alas! been made in the House of the
Lord."</p>

<h2>THE FONT</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">A</span> few weeks after the interview mentioned in the last
chapter, the Vicar preached three sermons from the
same text, St. John iii. 5: "Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
The first sermon was on the <i>necessity of Baptism</i>; the second,
on <i>its benefits</i>; and the third, on <i>its mode of administration</i>,
specially in the case of infants. Mr. Ambrose could not help
noticing that Mr. Dole was on each occasion deeply affected,
for he saw tears on his face, which evidently manifested deep
emotion within. He was, therefore, hardly surprised, when,
after his third sermon, a knock at the vestry-door announced a
visit from his parishioner.</p>

<p>"I have listened very attentively to your last three sermons,
Mr. Ambrose," said he, "and the subjects of them have also,
as you know, for a long time past been seriously and prayerfully
considered by me; I am now come to ask you to receive
me into the Church by Baptism."</p>

<p>"Have you never yet been baptized, my friend?" inquired
the Vicar, taking his hand in a kind and friendly way.</p>

<p>"No, I have not; when I was an infant, my parents objected
to my being baptized, and since I became a man, I must
confess with shame, that I have never had the <i>courage</i> to go
through the service at our <i>meeting</i>. That service, you know,
sir, is such as to deter far more courageous men&mdash;and specially
women&mdash;than I am, and I have always, too, had my doubts
about its propriety."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at that. I once, when a boy, attended
a baptism at one of your <i>meetings</i>, and I shall never forget it;
for a more unseemly spectacle I never witnessed. There were<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>
several young men and women immersed by the preacher, in a
large tank of water, in the middle of the meeting-house. Each
was clothed in a flannel garment fitting almost closely to the
body, and the appearance of the first of them was the signal for
a general rush to the best places for seeing; men and boys
climbed noisily over the pews, and some took their places on
the backs of the seats, so as to get a good view; and the whole
scene was most disorderly and irreverent.</p>

<p>"I have explained to you that our own Church also admits
of baptism by <i>immersion</i><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, but it does not <i>require</i> it, nor even
recommend it. Nevertheless occasionally persons desire it;
and there are a few churches, chiefly in Wales, where a
large tank of water, as well as a smaller font, is provided
for such special cases. But this mode of baptizing is not
encouraged by the Church, for these among other reasons:&mdash;It
is <i>not necessary</i>&mdash;for 1, the word <i>Baptism</i>, in the original,
does not necessarily mean entire immersion; 2, in the absence
of proof to the contrary, we may fairly conclude, from the
peculiar circumstances<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of the cases, that many of whose
baptism we read in the New Testament were not so immersed;
3, the Church from the earliest period has not considered
immersion as necessary to the validity of Baptism. It is also
<i>inconvenient</i>&mdash;for 1, in some cases it would be most difficult to
obtain sufficient water for the purpose; 2, in many cases there
would be much risk and danger attending its practice; 3, in all
cases there would be difficulty in securing that solemnity, propriety,
and order so desirable in the administration of this holy
sacrament. But the Baptism of adults, even according to the
Church's ordinary rules, is no small test of courage, as well as
sincerity. You are aware, no doubt, that your own Baptism
and reception into the Church must be <i>in the face of the congregation</i>.
The law of the Church is very plain on this point; it
distinctly forbids Baptism to be administered <i>privately</i>, either
at home or in the Church, 'unless upon a great and reasonable<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>
cause;' and it is much to be regretted that this rule has
ever been departed from."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have well considered that point."</p>

<p>The Vicar remained long that afternoon in the vestry in
serious conversation and earnest prayer with his parishioner.
He again went over the subject of the last three sermons;
showing, 1st, how the text could refer to nothing else than
holy Baptism, and that, if it did refer to it, then no doubt, where
it can be had, Baptism must be necessary for us, in order that
we may "enter into the kingdom of God;" 2ndly, that the
<i>promise</i> is as sure as the <i>warning</i>; and, 3rdly, that the terms
of the text are <i>unexceptional</i>, that they refer to <i>all mankind</i>
without any exception whatever, men, women, and children.
In speaking of these different subjects, of course he had to meet
the various objections which Dissenters are used to adduce;
but on all these points it was not very difficult to satisfy
the mind of one who had already freed himself from the
trammels of prejudice, and was earnestly seeking for the <i>truth</i>.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday afternoon therefore, after the second
lesson, Mr. Dole presented himself, with his chosen witnesses,
at the Font of St. Catherine's. The service was a very solemn
one, and all the congregation evidently took the greatest
interest in it. Mr. Dole made the responses in a firm manly
voice, its very tone seemed to say, "This is the result of my
deep and honest conviction; I have been wrong, and I am
not ashamed to say so before all those who are here present,
from whom I have so long been separated, but who are henceforth
my brethren in Christ." And then for the first time, he
quietly and calmly took his place on a bench at the west end
of the building&mdash;a sincere member of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>It was natural that the Squire and Vicar should have some
conversation after service on an event of so much importance
in the village as was this. They both foretold, and rightly,
the downfall of the little village "Bethel" as soon as its chief
supporter had left it.</p>

<p>Its former attendants came back to the Church one by one,
till at length the owner of the building, finding no prospect of
receiving his rent, closed the "Meeting," and appropriated it
to another purpose.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>The Vicar and Squire were standing near the Font, and the
conversation took its rise from the object before them.</p>

<p>"How often, Mr. Vicar, we find these old Norman Fonts
preserved, when there is hardly another bit of masonry remaining
in the church of the same date."</p>

<p>"Yes; and it is remarkable it should be so, considering the
exposed part of the church in which they are placed, and the
perishable stone of which they are not unfrequently composed;
besides which, the carvings upon them are often of so mysterious
and grotesque a character as naturally to excite the
wrath of the Puritan fanatics who so relentlessly destroyed the
beauty of our Houses of God, and 'brake down all the carved
work thereof with axes and hammers.'</p>

<p>"It is very interesting to watch the progress of architectural
changes as delineated on Fonts. Each period of ecclesiastical
architecture, as well in its general features as in its details, is
abundantly illustrated by the carvings and mouldings to be
found on Fonts. The early Fonts were with few exceptions
made of stone. Marble was seldom used till in comparatively
recent times. Some of the early Fonts had a solid leaden bowl,
placed on a stone base<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; I have never seen but one ancient
wooden Font<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>; that was placed on a stone base of the Norman
period, but was itself no doubt much later. The sculpture on
very ancient Fonts, as well as other church carving of the
time, sometimes borrowed its symbolism from the heathen
mythology which preceded it<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Constance Acres, who had been hitherto a quiet listener,
here asked Mr. Ambrose why the Font was always placed near
the door of the church.</p>

<p>"It's a natural inquiry, my dear, for one of your age," said
the Vicar, "but the reason is evident. Its position there, at
the entrance of the material fabric, fitly represents <i>Baptism</i> as
the outward form of admission into the Christian Church. The
Font, too, thus placed, should ever remind us, as we enter the
church, of the vows and promises made in our name when first
we were brought in our helpless infancy to be presented to God,
and to be made members of Christ through the grace of our
second birth. If people would only accustom themselves to
associate such thoughts with the baptismal Font, then just a
glance at it as they come into the church would be enough to
solemnize their minds, and help to fit them for the sacred
services in which they are about to take a part. It was once
the custom, Constance, to place what were called <i>stoups</i>, at the
entrances to our churches, and there are still remains of them
at the doors of many old churches. These were small basins,
made of stone, for the purpose of holding water, which&mdash;like
the water in the Font&mdash;was consecrated by the priest. When
persons came into the church, they dipped a finger in the
basin, and crossed their forehead with the water, just as the
priest now crosses the brow of the person who has been baptized.
The <i>forehead</i>, you know, is always regarded as the seat
of <i>shame</i> or <i>courage</i><a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>; and so the person, when baptized, is
signed with 'the sign of the <i>Cross</i>, in token that hereafter he
shall <i>not be ashamed</i> to confess the faith of <i>Christ crucified</i>.'
The old custom of frequent crossing with holy water has now
for a long time been discontinued by us, the practice was
regarded by many as superstitious, nor does there appear to be
authority for it in the Primitive Church. The same motive
which prompted the use of the <i>stoup</i>, however, still induces
some persons to use the sign of the Cross on entering a church:
I do not myself do so; not that I see any harm in the practice
in itself, as it is intended to remind persons of the Sacred
Presence to which they are about to enter, and to drive away
worldly thoughts by this memento of the crucifixion of their<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>
Lord; but I think it is better, in my own case, as some would
be offended by it, to try to accomplish this right object by other
means."</p>

<p>"People's minds have very much changed in late years
respecting the use of the Cross," said Mr. Acres. "A few
years ago not only was the sign of the Cross in baptism considered
superstitious, but it was considered even wrong to use it
in church architecture, or as an ornament within the church,
or as a part of a memorial in the churchyard; there are few
now, I suppose, who regard such use of the sacred symbol as
superstitious. I was in a bookseller's shop the other day when
a 'Baptist' preacher came in to purchase a Prayer Book to
present to a friend; the bookseller said to him, 'Of course
that will not suit you, sir, as it has a Cross upon it.' 'I like the
book very much,' was his reply; 'and as for the Cross, why
the Puritans may object to that if they like, I don't.' But
I am of opinion that people are going a little in the opposite
extreme, and, at least as a personal <i>ornament</i>, the Cross is
become too common."</p>

<p>"Why <i>do</i> you fall into the popular error, my good friend,"
said the Vicar, reprovingly, "of calling these Anabaptist
preachers, <i>Baptists</i>? Surely they ought to be called any thing
rather than <i>Baptists</i>, for they make more light of Baptism than
any other people who can properly be said to believe in Baptism
at all. Do let us call things by their proper names;&mdash;why, to
call them <i>Baptists</i>, is almost as bad as to call Roman Catholics,
<i>Catholics</i>, and so to ignore our own claim to be members of the
Christian Church, because we allow them a name which would
imply that <i>they</i> are the <i>only</i> Church in the world. I need not
tell you that the word ANA<i>baptist</i><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> exactly expresses what they
are, namely, they who <i>baptize a second time</i> those who have
already been baptized in infancy. The term 'Baptist' is far
more applicable to Church people than to them."</p>

<p>"I see, I deserve your rebuke: mine is a mistake too often
made. By-the-bye, Mr. Vicar, I was very pleased to hear your
reply to Mr. Dole, when he inquired what was the <i>fee</i> to be
paid for his baptism. I heard you tell him that the sacraments
of the Church were always <i>free</i>."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, certainly I did; and I confess I cannot understand
how any one can dare, in these days, to demand a fee for
Baptism; the claim is as <i>illegal</i> as it is <i>unchristian</i>, and I
believe goes far to make the poor take a low view of this holy
rite. I wish, too, I could make the poor understand that
<i>Baptism</i> has nothing to do with <i>Registration</i>; many of the
most ignorant of them really regard them as the same thing.
Some of them, too, will persist in thinking that to be <i>privately
baptized</i>, is to be '<i>half baptized</i>.' Of course <i>they must be altogether
baptized, or not baptized at all</i>; but they do not readily
see that the <i>baptism</i> is complete, though the <i>reception into the
Church</i> is not perfected till the service is concluded in the face
of the congregation."</p>

<h2>THE PULPIT</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"I</span> suppose we must not expect you to conform to all
our usages at first, Mr. Dole," said Mr. Acres, as they
walked out of the churchyard one Sunday, after the Afternoon
Service; "but no doubt you will soon see the fitness of our
several forms and ceremonies, and then you will do as we do.
Of course these things are&mdash;compared with others&mdash;of no great
importance; but still it is better, even in small matters, to
avoid differences in our mode of worship."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so, sir; but you must give me time, and I
shall be glad if you will tell me what you have specially noticed
in my manner different from others? I don't wish to seem
particular."</p>

<p>"Well, to be candid then, Mr. Dole, it seems strange to us to
see a man when he comes into church <i>stand up</i> and say his
prayers in his <i>hat</i>, instead of reverently <i>kneeling down</i>."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that before, but I dare say it does; but
then you know, sir, that is our way at the <i>meeting</i>. I see, however,
that it is much more proper in God's house to obey
the precept of His Holy Word, and 'fall low on our knees
before His footstool.'"</p>

<p>"Then for the same reason you will, I am sure, see that,
instead of <i>sitting</i> during the other prayers, as I notice you do,
it is proper to <i>kneel</i> at those times too. You will find that all
in our church, from the oldest to the youngest, except poor Old
Reynolds and Tom Barham (who are too infirm to kneel), do
so. Then again, when the <i>Creed</i> is said, I see you do sometimes
stand up, but not always; and I notice you don't turn to
the <i>East</i>, as all the rest of the congregation do."</p>

<p>"No, I confess I don't do that. I like the idea of repeating
our Confession of Faith whenever we meet at church: I suppose<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>
the want of this practice is one reason why the different leading
sects of Dissenters are constantly being broken up into fresh
divisions. Yes, there is certainly something very supporting to
a Christian in so declaring with the Church every where, his
belief in the great doctrines of their common Faith; but the
fact is, I have some scruples about turning to the East at that
time. Even old Mrs. Tubbs, who, you know, is a Church-woman,
says she thinks it is superstitious."</p>

<p>"All I can say, then, is, that Mrs. Tubbs doesn't know the
meaning of the word she uses; and in this she is like a great
many more people who think themselves very wise about these
matters. Now, my good friend, when you next come to church,
stand up with the rest, and turn to the East as the others do,
and first say to yourself some such words as these:&mdash;'We all
<i>stand</i>, to signify that we are <i>not ashamed</i> of our Belief, and
that, if need be, we will manfully defend it. We all <i>turn in
one direction</i>, to signify that we all hold <i>one and the same faith</i>.
We all turn to the <i>East</i>, because there in the east of our
churches every thing reminds us of the presence of Him in
whom we profess our belief; because there, in remembrance
of Him, we celebrate the highest and most sacred mysteries of
our Faith; and because the East specially reminds us of the
holy life, the Divine teaching, the miracles, the suffering, the
death of our Blessed Lord&mdash;"the <i>Sun</i> of Righteousness," "the
<i>Day-spring</i> from on high"&mdash;<i>in the East</i><a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.' Do this, Mr. Dole,
and you will never again be disposed to regard this custom as
superstitious. Why, some people even think it is superstitious
to bend the head reverently at the name of Jesus, when it is
mentioned in the Creeds and the other parts of the Service."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, though once I did. Since I have considered
more about it, it has seemed to me that some outward
show of reverence at the mention of the Sacred Name is quite
Scriptural<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. But as I am yet only a learner about these outward
forms, will you kindly tell me, sir, whether there is any
rule of the Church about this custom?"<span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>"The Vicar will be able to answer that better than I can."</p>

<p>"I could not help overhearing our friend's question," said
Mr. Ambrose, "as I was close behind you, and I will answer it
at once. The rule of our Church is very plain on this point;
it is this: 'All manner of persons present shall reverently kneel
upon their knees, when the general Confession, Litany, and
other prayers are read; and shall stand up at the saying of the
Belief, according to the rules in that behalf prescribed in the
Book of Common Prayer; and likewise, when in time of
Divine Service the Lord Jesus shall be mentioned, due and
lowly reverence shall be done by all persons present, as it
hath been accustomed: testifying, by these outward ceremonies
and gestures, their inward humility, Christian resolution, and
due acknowledgment that the Lord Jesus Christ, the true
eternal Son of God, is the only Saviour of the world<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Ambrose, nothing could be plainer, or
more reasonable than that direction; but, you see, I have for so
many years <i>sat under</i> Mr. Scole, who never taught us any thing
of this sort, that you will forgive me if I seem a little more
ignorant than those who have been all the time <i>sitting under</i> you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'sitting under,' my friend?" said
the Vicar, very innocently.</p>

<p>"I mean <i>hearing you preach</i>," was Mr. Dole's reply. "It's a
curious expression, now I come to think about it."</p>

<p>"It certainly is so, and the meaning of it is not very clear.
But in our Church we don't talk about <i>sitting under</i>, or <i>hearing</i>
this or that preacher. We simply say we attend this or that
church, as the case may be. And the reason is, that&mdash;although
very important in its proper place&mdash;we consider preaching of
little moment (and the preacher of far less), when compared
with the other objects of Christian worship,&mdash;<i>Prayer</i> and
<i>Praise</i>. We look upon God's House as pre-eminently 'a
House of Prayer.'"</p>

<p>"Well, I do think we used to make too much of the sermon
at the meeting; and I remember all our conversation afterwards
was about the sermon or the preacher. One Sunday
we had a young gent. from London, Mr. Sweetly, to preach,
and our people never ceased to talk about him. I believe,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>
however, none of them recollected a word he said; but they
could remember well enough 'his lovely voice,' and 'how nice
he looked in his beautiful black silk gown' (you know, sir, our
people always preach in black gowns), 'and those charming
lavender gloves! and then the sweetest embroidered white lawn
pocket-handkerchief imaginable!' It had just been presented
to him, he told me, by a young lady&mdash;Miss Angelina Gushing&mdash;who
sat under him at his London meeting-house. I never
was a preacher-worshipper myself, sir."</p>

<p>"Save me from the man with the <i>lavender gloves and the
white embroidered pocket-handkerchief</i>, I say," said Mr. Acres.
"If there is one thing in nature I shrink from more than
another, it is a <i>fop</i>, and a <i>fop</i> in the pulpit is beyond endurance."</p>

<p>"A most offensive person, indeed," said the Vicar, "and one
that brings great discredit upon the ministry; but it can be no
matter of surprise that men sometimes a little over-estimate
themselves in some of our fashionable towns, where the people
(specially the ladies) flock to <i>hear</i> 'dear' Mr. Somebody, and
so abundantly supply him with those articles of personal furniture
which are usually the reward of a popular preacher. It is
not so very long ago that in our own church every thing was
made to give way to the sermon. You remember, Mr. Acres,
when many of the people in St. Catherine's used to sit and
sleep through the prayers<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, and just wake up for the sermon.
Then the pulpit was every thing, and little else could be seen
by the people; the galleries were built so that the people might
sit and see the preacher, and the pews were likewise built up
only with a view to sitting comfortable during the sermon. It
is all different now, I am thankful to say, and the pulpit takes
once more its old and appropriate position. But we must
take care not to esteem too lightly the office of the preacher,
in our contempt for one who preaches merely to <i>please the
people</i>. To 'preach the Word' is one of the solemn duties laid
upon us at our ordination; and woe be to us if we neglect to do
so earnestly and faithfully!"</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"I</span>t's curious to
note," continued
the Vicar, "how
the Pulpit and the
Gallery have kept
company in rising
higher and higher.
At first the pulpit
was placed at a moderate
height above
the congregation, and
then the church improvers
(?) were
usually contented
with erecting a small
low gallery at the
west end of the
church<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. It is true,
that was bad enough;
for in order to construct
it, it was
nearly always thought
necessary to fill in
the tower arch and
to hide the western window&mdash;often the most beautiful features
in the church; and then the organ was taken up into
this gallery, and the singers followed it; and nothing, you
know, could be more inconvenient than that those who help<span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>
to <i>lead</i> the services of the Church should be <i>behind</i> those they
profess to lead. But when people had once tasted the luxury
of sitting in a church gallery, the demand for it rapidly increased,
and my Lady Pride, who had very comfortable
crimson-cushioned seats in her box at the theatre, could not
be content without an equally comfortable and elegant <i>box</i>
in the gallery at her church, where she could see all the people
quite as well as in her box at the theatre, and had such a good
view of the pulpit and its occupant, that, with a good opera-glass,
she could even read the manuscript from which the
clergyman was preaching. As the taste spread, of course
galleries multiplied, and not only extended in a lateral direction
over all available parts of the church, but sometimes
mounted up one above another (as witness many of our
London churches) till they almost touched the very roof.
Indeed, to build a new gallery was one of the most popular
things a local magnate could do; and even Members of
Parliament, who desired to make sure of their next election,
could hardly adopt better means for recommending themselves
to their constituents than by disfiguring their church
with one of these hideous structures, and recording the same
on some conspicuous part of the church<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. But worse still;
these galleries were sometimes even still more nearly connected
with the political parties of the day. I know one church<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>&mdash;and
that is not the only instance&mdash;in which are galleries,
having complete opera-boxes, furnished with luxurious chairs,
stoves, &amp;c., and every box is a two-pound freehold, and the
boxes are, from time to time, advertised for sale, with the
inviting recommendation that each one <i>gives a vote for the
county</i>. One great piece of presumptuous vanity connected
with these galleries, is the numberless instances in which the
names of churchwardens, that otherwise would have been
unknown to fame, have been emblazoned upon them."</p>

<p>"You remember, no doubt," said Mr. Acres, "the inscription,
in large gilt letters, that covered the front of our old
gallery&mdash;'This gallery was erected A.D. 1716, Thomas Grubb
and Matthew Stokes, Churchwardens; enlarged, and newly
painted and ornamented, A.D. 1760, Peter Jenks and Samuel<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>
Styles, Churchwardens.' I believe I have read that inscription
thousands of times, and those names used even to haunt
me in my dreams. Had those churchwardens been four of
the greatest saints in the calendar, it would have been gross
impiety to emblazon their names so conspicuously as thus to
force them upon one's notice during the whole service. If,
however, tradition does not speak falsely of them, those men
were by no means too correct either in their private life or in
their parish accounts. But let them be never so good, people
who go to church for Christian worship, don't wish to have the
names and exploits of these worthy or unworthy men staring
them in the face every moment they are there. But I beg
your pardon, Mr. Vicar, I interrupted you when you were
speaking of the pulpit."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, when the gallery had reached the ceiling,
it could go no higher; but then its upper tenants could no
longer see the preacher. So the pulpit rose too, and, to enable
all to see it, sometimes took its place just in front of the altar,
so as completely to hide that from most of the congregation; nay,
I have seen it even over the altar itself<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. Then the prayer-desk
came climbing up after the pulpit; and then the clerk's
desk came creeping up below them, till that, too, became
one of the most conspicuous and important objects of the
church. Thus the three together grew into that clumsy,
unsightly mass which has been not inaptly called the <i>Three
Decker</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I shall never forget poor old Mowforth's perplexity,"
said Mr. Acres, "when he looked about for his peculiar box in
our restored church. First he looked doubtingly at your prayer-desk;
then he examined the lectern from which you read the
lessons; then he looked with some faint hope at the pulpit; at
last he came to me, and said, 'Please, sir, which of these is to
be my place?' and his look of dismay was indescribable when
I told him that, as you intended that henceforth the choir
should lead the responses, he would be absorbed in the congregation,
and would in future be able to take his place with
the rest of his family. But the man is a sensible fellow, and
he confessed to me the other day that he considers the new<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>
arrangement a great improvement, and wonders that the people
could have so long endured the duet service in which only the
voices of the parson and himself could be heard. But we have
again wandered a little from our subject. Let us go back to
the pulpit; it must have a history of its own, like every other
part of the church. Will you kindly enlighten me and our
friend here on the subject? for it must be one of much interest
to us both."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;to begin at the beginning&mdash;I suppose we must look
for the origin of our pulpits in the 'brazen scaffold' which
Solomon set 'in the midst of the Temple<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>,' and the 'pulpit of
wood<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>' from which Ezra read the Book of the Law.</p>

<p>"There are in this country many very beautiful examples of
ancient pulpits; these are, with but very few exceptions, constructed
of <i>stone</i>, and very generally of the same date as the
church itself. Sometimes they were erected outside the
church<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, but usually in the place where we are still accustomed
to see them. Sometimes stone pulpits were quite separate
buildings, erected in some much frequented place, usually near
a cathedral or other church<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. 'In the ancient rites of Durham
there is mention of a "fine <i>iron</i> pulpit, with iron rails to support
the monks in going up, of whom one did preach every
holiday and Sunday at one o'clock in the afternoon." This
was situated in the Galilee, or western division of the church,
which was open to the public even when the entrance to the
rest of the church was interdicted<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.' Although the most beautiful
pulpits, both ancient and modern, are of stone&mdash;many of
them being richly carved and inlaid with costly marbles&mdash;yet<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>
the greater number of the more modern pulpits are made of
wood<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. By an injunction of Queen Elizabeth in 1559, pulpits
were ordered to be erected in all churches<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, and by a canon
of 1663 it was ordered that pulpits should be placed in all
the churches of the country not already provided with them.
The pulpits then erected were in almost every case made of
wood, and their pattern has since then been generally, though
by no means universally, followed.</p>

<p>"A curious appendage to the pulpit sometimes found is
the horologium, or hour-glass. Whether this was placed there
for the information of the congregation as to the progress
of the hour, or to teach them its own solemn moral, or as a
guide to the preacher respecting the length of his discourse<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>, I
cannot say. Another adjunct to the pulpit is the sounding-board,
or, as it should rather be called, the <i>lid</i> or <i>cover</i> of the pulpit;
and a thing more useless, and usually more ugly, one cannot
conceive<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. It certainly always seems to me rather to impede
the sound of my voice than to assist it; and then it has, to
say the least, a most uncomfortable appearance; and though I
never heard of the accident really happening, yet it always
appears to me to be on the point of falling and crushing the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>
poor preacher below it. It is not, however, difficult to trace
the origin of these covers to the pulpit; they were really
necessary where the pulpits were <i>separate buildings</i>&mdash;as at St.
Paul's Cross&mdash;in order to protect the preacher when the
weather was inclement. At St. Paul's Cross, and at the Cross
Pulpit at Norwich, and probably elsewhere, not only the
preacher, but also the audience, were provided with such a
shelter<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell us," said Mr. Dole, "why you discarded
the large handsome velvet cushion that was once on
your pulpit, and have, instead, adopted the embroidered piece
of velvet which now hangs in front of the pulpit?"</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of taste, I think you will agree with me
that the present beautiful frontal, with its richly-embroidered
cross, is an improvement upon the old cushion. But I discarded
the old big <i>pillow</i>&mdash;for such, indeed, it was&mdash;not only because
it was unsightly, but also because it was useless, for my head
is not so much more tender than that of other persons, that
I, any more than they, should require a pillow to rest it on
during my private devotions; and as I am not accustomed to
perform the part of a mountebank in the pulpit, or, as some
say, to use much <i>action</i> when preaching, I need no such protection
in order to preserve my limbs safe and sound. But,
besides this, there is a manifest objection to these huge
cushions; undoubtedly they tend to impede the sound of the
preacher's voice<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>; so I was very glad to get rid of your handsome
cushion, and adopt our more convenient and more
beautiful pulpit frontal."</p>

<p>"I often think," said Mr. Acres, "if the old pulpits could
speak, what a strange account they would give of the various
preachers that have occupied them. Take our own old stone
pulpit, for instance. In early times, of course, there were only
sermons at long intervals, perhaps often dependent upon the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>
occasional visits of some old preaching friar. At length there
came the quaint old Homilies of the Church; then there came
an interruption to all true religion and order, and the old pulpit
poured forth the mad ravings of the fanatical Puritans who got
possession of it. Now and then came a noisy soldier to hold
forth, and there was&mdash;as our old registers show&mdash;the <i>Reverend</i>
Ebenezer Bradshaw, the Presbyterian, who left his snuff and
tobacco shop to enlighten our poor benighted people; next
came the <i>Reverend</i> Obadiah Brent, late of the 'Green Dragon,'
the Independent preacher; and then the <i>Reverend</i> Jabez
Zanchy, the baker of Starchcombe, the Anabaptist preacher<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>;
then there was a century of long learned essays freely interspersed
with Greek and Latin, so that, if the prayers were
said in a language 'understanded of the people,' the sermon
certainly was not. Following upon this came what we may
call the <i>muscular</i> style of preaching&mdash;usually extempore&mdash;requiring
the pillows of which you have been speaking to save
the knuckles of the preacher from entire demolition. Thank
God, amid these many changes, there have always been some
good men to be found in our pulpits; but, for my part, I like
the quiet, sober, persuasive style, which&mdash;saving your presence,
Mr. Vicar&mdash;I am thankful to say, characterizes the sermons
at St. Catherine's. I think sermons cannot be too <i>practical</i>;
and, whilst they should be addressed both to the heart and the
intellect, they should most of all be designed to touch the
<i>heart</i>."</p>

<h2>THE NAVE</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"A</span>h, Mr. Beeland, I'm so glad to see you!" said the
Vicar, as, on leaving the church, he met his neighbour
the newly-appointed Vicar of Droneworth. "I have been
much grieved to hear of the sad opposition you have had to
encounter in restoring your fine old church; but this was sure
to be the case in a parish like yours, which has been so long
neglected; indeed it must be so, more or less, in every parish,
so long as there are people who honour themselves much more
than they honour God; and such, I suppose, there will be till
the end of the world. You may be sure, my friend, the woe
of universal commendation<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> never yet fell upon any <i>church
restorer</i>."</p>

<p>"Never, certainly. But what makes our position often so
difficult and so painful is the fact that, whilst we are fully
sensible of the rectitude of our own course, we cannot help, to
some extent, sympathizing in the feelings of those who blame us.
For instance, in almost every case of church restoration it is
necessary to disturb a large number of human bones, and yet
we can but sympathize in that feeling of respect for the
departed, which sometimes expresses itself in the most
strenuous opposition to any work involving this painful necessity.
Then, you see, there is the rooting up of long-cherished
associations. We have a case in point close at hand. There's
the grand old church of Rainsborough will be left in its
miserable condition so long as the present Vicar lives, and
for no other reason than this:&mdash;ten years since he lost a
favourite daughter, and she had always been accustomed to
sit in one particular corner of their large pew." Now the
Vicar fears (and no doubt justly) that should the church be
altered, the old pew with its fond associations would be swept<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>
away&mdash;and so the church will never be improved as long as he
lives<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. We must respect the old man's tender love for the
spot sacred to the memory of his dear child, yet we plainly see
it is all wrong that for the sake of the private feelings (however
praiseworthy) of any one person, God's house should remain in
a state of neglect, and the poor should be uncared for therein.
This, however, is an oft-told tale. But most of all, we have to
contend against <i>wounded pride</i> in its most cherished strong-hold&mdash;alas!&mdash;the
Church of God; and the enemy is all the
more fierce because it is prostrate.</p>

<p>"My two great opponents, Sir John Adamley and Mr. Parvener,
are to meet me this evening, and I am come to ask you
and Mr. Acres to walk back with me to Droneworth, so that I
may have the benefit of your support. You see these two
gentlemen had pews in the nave of our church, lined, cushioned,
and carpeted in dazzling crimson; each pew was as large as a
good-sized room, and the two occupied nearly half the nave.
Mr. Parvener was generally at church once on a Sunday, and
then he sat not only in luxurious ease, but also in solitary
dignity. Sir John never came to church, as there was some
old feud respecting the right owner of his pew; but the door
was always locked, and a canvas cover was stretched over the
top. These precautions, however, failed to keep out an
occasional intruder, and at last the door was securely <i>nailed
up</i><a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. The worst of it was, that all this time there was not a
seat in the church which a poor man could occupy with any
chance of either seeing or hearing the ministering Priest.
Now people talk about <i>proper</i> distinctions in church between
the high and the low, and we sometimes hear much about old
ancestral pews. Believe me, it's all nonsense, my dear sir; the
distinction is <i>solely between riches and poverty</i>. If a man has
plenty of money, he may (or rather, till lately he might) secure<span class="pagenum">[Pg 193] </span>
the biggest pew in England; and if he has not money, though
he be entitled to quarter the royal arms on his escutcheon, he
will get no pew at all. Mr. Parvener is an exact instance of
this. But a few years since he was working for half-a-crown a
day. No sooner did he become wealthy than he obtained a
large pew at our church, whilst its former owner, whose fall had
been as complete and rapid as was the rise of his successor,
was driven to a remote corner of the church allotted to degraded
poverty."</p>

<p>The walk to Droneworth was soon accomplished, but the
Rector with his two friends only reached the Parsonage a few
moments before the arrival of the two aggrieved parishioners.
It was evident from the first greeting that they had come in no
friendly spirit. But few words passed before Sir John came
direct to the object of the interview.</p>

<p>"The purpose of our visit," said Sir John, "you are aware,
is to protest against the removal of our pews at church, and to
declare our determination to have them replaced if it is possible."</p>

<p>"But, gentlemen, you are aware that we have provided good
accommodation for you in the restored church," replied the
Vicar.</p>

<p>"Good accommodation, sir!" exclaimed Sir John. "Why,
you have given us nothing but low wooden benches to sit
upon; and, to add to the insult, sir, there is not the semblance
of a <i>door</i>; so that our devotions may at any time be interrupted
by the presence of an inferior. Why, sir, the very
labourers, who earn their half-crown a day, have seats in the
church just as good as ours!"</p>

<p>The last sentence made poor Mr. Parvener writhe a little;
and that indeed was its real intention, for the two neighbours
had, in truth, little love for each other. The words, however,
accomplished another and a better purpose; they broke up at
once any thing like united action on the part of the opposition.</p>

<p>"Let me ask you, gentlemen, a very simple question," said
the Vicar. "<i>Why should not</i> the labourer have as good a
place in God's house as yourselves?"</p>

<p>"You might as well ask," said the Baronet, "why they
should not have as good houses as we have."</p>

<p>"The cases are in no way similar. You live in better<span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
houses than the poor, simply because your worldly means
enable you to do so; but I have yet to be taught that in the
Church wealth is to be exalted and poverty degraded. No,
Sir John, be sure this distinction is out of place <i>there</i>. We go
to church to <i>worship</i> and to <i>learn</i>, and if favour is shown to
any class, no doubt it should be to the ignorant and the poor;
but this is a matter on which we are not left to our own judgment.
There are not many instructions in our Bibles as to
the manner of arranging our churches, but here the direction is
plain and unmistakable."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir! I had no idea that any thing about church
seats was to be found in the Bible."</p>

<p>"Oh, but indeed there is. The passage to which I refer
is in St. James' Epistle; and it is this: '<i>My brethren, have
not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory,
with respect of persons. For if there come unto your assembly
a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in
also a poor man in vile raiment; and ye have respect to him that
weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a
good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under
my footstool: are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become
judges of evil thoughts<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>?</i>'"</p>

<p>"If those words are in the Bible, I must confess the Bible is
against me; but I had no idea that they were there."</p>

<p>"I assure you they are the exact words of Holy Scripture."</p>

<p>"It's clear enough to me," interposed Mr. Parvener, "that
the labourer ought to have as good a place at church as the
lord. I don't think the church is the place to show off aristocratic
pride. Why, for that matter, there's many a man that
doesn't know who was his grandfather doing more for the
glory of God and the good of his fellow-creatures than your
grandest aristocrats." This was intended as a counter-thrust,
and it created a wider breach in the enemy's camp.
"But," continued he, "I don't see why, if all have good places
in the church, we should not make our own seats as comfortable
as we can."</p>

<p>"Ah, but there comes in just what St. James tells us we
ought to keep out: the distinction between <i>riches and poverty</i>,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]  </span>
distinctions which among our fellow-men have their advantages,
but not before God in His house. Just hear what St.
James says again: 'Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not
God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of
the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him?
But ye have despised the poor<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.' I was much struck with a
sermon I heard the other day on this subject. The preacher
said, 'If our Lord Jesus Christ were to enter some of our
churches just as He went to the temple at Jerusalem, do you
think He would take His seat in the luxuriously furnished pew
of the rich, or in the open bench of the poor<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>?' Now, let me
ask you too, Mr. Parvener (for this is, after all, the sum and
substance of the matter), do you think that He 'who was rich,
yet for our sakes became poor<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>,' and whose life was a perfect
pattern of <i>humility</i>, would sanction the distinctions which
either pride of station, or pride of riches, would create in the
House of Prayer?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I must say that's a solemn question, and it sets
one a-thinking more than I have thought before about this."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Beeland," said Sir John, interrupting, for he saw
the ground of his arguments was slipping from under him,
"you will acknowledge that these open benches in church are a
<i>novelty</i>, and you often talk to us about keeping to the <i>old paths</i>.
Now, here you are teaching us to strike out a new way altogether.
I wish I knew something more than I do about the
history of these pews."</p>

<p>"I anticipated some such remark from you, and knowing
that my friend Mr. Ambrose is more learned than I am in all
these subjects, I induced him to join us this evening, and if he
will kindly give us the benefit of his information, he will, I am
sure, convince you that <i>pews, and not benches, are the modern
innovation</i>."</p>

<p>"If you can have patience to listen to me," said the Vicar
of St. Catherine's, "I will gladly give you the history of pews,
as far I know it."</p>

<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"I</span>n order to trace the history of pews<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> to their first
source, I must, as Mr. Beeland has hinted, go back to
a time when pews, as we now see them, had never been
thought of. It is pretty certain that the first seats in churches
were stone benches placed round the north, south, and west
walls, portions of which are still remaining in many old
churches<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. In some ancient churches in Ireland the stone
bench has also been found adjoining the <i>eastern</i> wall, the altar
being placed a little distance before it. In those early times
people were far less self-indulgent than at present in God's
House, and the usual custom was to stand or kneel during
the whole service. The first wooden seats were small stools,
each intended to seat one person, and placed in the nave as
suited the convenience of each occupier. Then came plain
benches, and next, benches with backs to them. The priest's
<i>reading-pew</i> was probably the origin of all pews. They seem to
have been unknown in any form till the end of the thirteenth
century, but the earliest record we have of a pew is 1602<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.
Next to the 'reading-pew' came the 'bride's pew<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>,' the 'churching-pew,'
and the 'churchwarden's pew.' In the nave of Little<span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]  </span>
Berningham Church, Norfolk, is a pew erected by a shepherd;
a skeleton carved in wood is fixed at the south-west corner of
it, and these lines are carved on the pew:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The general adoption of pews began with Puritanism, and
with its increase they too grew in width and stature. First of
all, people were satisfied with the uniform arrangement and
space of the old oak benches, only erecting on the top of
them an ugly and useless panelling of deal. This was bad
enough, but worse soon followed; and, to make the seats more
luxurious, first one bench was taken away, and the <i>two
benches</i> made <i>one pew</i>; then two were removed, then three,
till at last it required the removal of <i>six benches</i>, which
formerly would accommodate thirty persons, to make <i>one pew</i>
to accommodate two or three. Now, either men are giants
in these days and were pigmies in those days, or else the pride
and luxury of man claim a prominence now in God's House,
which was quite unknown then. I will ask either of you, gentlemen,
to decide which is the true explanation."</p>

<p>"I fear it must be against ourselves," said Mr. Parvener.</p>

<p>"I fear so, indeed<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. But now let me explain to you more
fully what are the real evils of this wretched pew system. And
first, as to the <i>private pew</i>&mdash;for, besides sharing in the evils of
<i>all</i> the rest, <i>it</i> has some peculiarly its own. Of these, the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]  </span>
<i>pride</i> it fosters, and the '<i>respect of persons</i>,' so severely condemned
by St. James, are the worst. My dear sir, I assure
you it has often made my blood boil to see some poor old man
with his venerable bare head exposed to the cold draught of a
neglected part of the church, whilst a young, pampered son of
fortune has been cushioned up under the stately canopy of his
own pew<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. Oh, sir, I'm sure you must agree with me that this
is altogether against the spirit of Christianity! I'm no leveller
<i>out of church</i>; the social distinctions must be there kept up;
but <i>in God's House</i> these should have no place at all. Then,
surely, the <i>luxury</i> of many of these private pews is altogether
inconsistent with the object of our meeting in the House of
Prayer. It is&mdash;as it shows the progress of luxury, and its concomitant,
effeminacy&mdash;a curious circumstance, that when the
custom of having pews in our churches began to spread, they
were, by our hardy ancestors, considered as <i>too great indulgences</i>,
and as temptations to repose. Their curtains and bed-furniture,
their <i>cushions</i> and <i>sleep</i>, have, by a long association
of ideas, become intimately connected. The Puritans thought
<i>pews</i> the devil's <i>baby</i>, or <i>booby hutches</i><a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. I have heard that in
America they go even beyond us in the luxury of pews, and
that in Boston some of them are actually lined with <i>velvet</i><a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. I
believe that both there and here the private pew system has<span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]  </span>
done very much, not only to force the poor from the Church,
but to drive many of all classes over to dissent."</p>

<p>"I can't see how that can be," said the Baronet.</p>

<p>Why, "naturally enough, sir, for they find all this the very
opposite to what the Church professes to be and to teach.
They see the rich exalted, and the poor debased; they find a
house of pride, instead of a house of prayer.</p>

<p>"The <i>exclusiveness</i> of this system is one of the most curious
as well as absurd features in its history. True, the change in
our social habits has created a change for the better here; but
much of the old temper survives. You would hardly believe,
perhaps, that years ago it was not only considered an impropriety
for the squire and the dame to sit in the same pew with
any of their inferior fellow-worshippers, but the presence of
their own children<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> was even considered an indecent intrusion.
This was, indeed, ridiculous; but, in truth, the whole system
would be monstrously grotesque, were it not so very wicked.</p>

<p>"There is a curious inscription on an old seat in a church
at Whalley, which seems to throw some light on the early
history of private pews; it is this:&mdash;'My man Shuttleworth,
of Hacking, made this form, and here will I sit when I come,
and my Cousin Nowell may make one behind me if he please,
and my sonne Sherburne shall make one on the other side,
and Mr. Catterall another behind him; and for the residue, the
use shall be first come first speed, and that will make the proud
wives of Whalley rise betimes to come to church<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.'</p>

<p>"The first seat thus appropriated was, no doubt, a rude
wooden bench; but certain it is, that no sooner were even these
claimed as private property than <i>quarrelling</i> began<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>; and the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]  </span>
quarrel has, alas! been kept up to our own day. The right
to these <i>faculty pews</i>, as they are called, is, however, in most
cases very questionable, and often leads to costly law processes<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.
Many sensible men and earnest Churchmen are
giving up their supposed right to them, and are contented to
take their place in church like <i>ordinary mortals</i>. I sincerely
trust, gentlemen, this may be your case.</p>

<p>"Now, let me notice a few of the evils which are common
to <i>all pews</i>. They tend to destroy the <i>unity</i> and <i>uniformity</i> of
common worship, which forms so grand a feature in our
church system. 'They are very inconvenient to <i>kneel</i> down
in, necessarily oblige some to sit with their backs to the
speaker, and when they rise up, present a scene of confusion,
as if they were running their heads against one another<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. As
God's House is a House of Praise and Prayer, so before all
things the arrangement there should have reference to the
proper <i>posture</i><a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of praise and prayer. Then see how these
pews shelter and encourage <i>levity</i> in God's House. As long
ago as the year 1662, a bishop of Norwich wrote this satire
upon pews: 'There wants nothing but beds to hear the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]  </span>
Word of God on. We have casements, locks and keys, and
cushions&mdash;I had almost said bolsters and pillows&mdash;and for
those we love the church. I will not guess what is done
within them: who sits, stands, or lies asleep at prayers, communion,
&amp;c.; but this, I dare say, <i>they are either to hide some
vice or to proclaim one</i><a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.' I will only mention one more objection
to pews: they harbour dust and dirt<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>, and otherwise
disfigure the beauty of our churches."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Ambrose, I must confess myself brought to the
same opinion as yourself," said Sir John, "and the reformation
of the evil may commence at Droneworth to-morrow without
any obstacle whatever from me."</p>

<p>"Nor yet from me," rejoined Mr. Parvener: "I certainly
never heard the case fairly stated before, and now I have, I
own I'm convinced."</p>

<p>"Heartily glad, I'm sure, my friend here must be to part
with the old <i>half empty packing-cases</i>, and to see proper
benches in their place. And as you have been kind enough
to listen to me so far, I will just say a few more words to explain
the two desks which the Vicar has placed in the nave of
your church, and of which I heard you had disapproved.
One is the <i>Litany-desk</i>, or <i>faldstool</i><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>,&mdash;as it is called in the
Coronation Service. The Litany is a very solemn, penitential
service, and from very early times it has been said from the
appropriate place where the Vicar has placed the Litany-desk
in your church&mdash;namely, just at the entrance to the chancel.
Its position there has reference to that Litany of God's own
appointing, of which we read in the Book of Joel<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, where, in
a general assembly, the priests were to weep <i>between the porch
and the altar</i>, and to say, '<i>Spare Thy people, O Lord</i>.' In allusion
to this, our Litany&mdash;retaining also the same words of
supplication&mdash;is enjoined, by the royal injunctions<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>, still in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]    </span>
force, 'to be said or sung in the midst of the church, at a low
desk before the chancel-door<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.' The other desk is called the
<i>lectern</i>, or <i>lettern</i>, and sometimes the <i>eagle-desk</i>; and, as
you are aware, is the desk from which the lessons are read.
They were first made of wood, and often richly carved; afterwards
they were commonly made of brass or copper. They
were first used about the end of the thirteenth century, and
although most of our country churches have been despoiled of
them, yet they have never ceased to be used in our cathedrals,
as well as many other churches<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. The desk is often supported
by a pelican feeding its young with its own blood, the emblem
of our Saviour's love; more frequently it is supported by
an eagle, the symbolic representation of the Evangelist St.
John. It is true that both the faldstool and the lectern have long
been unknown at Droneworth, yet I feel sure you will not,
on second thoughts, consider the restoration of such convenient
and appropriate furniture as objectionable."</p>

<p>The two late dissentients agreed that as they had overcome
the greater difficulty, they should withdraw all opposition
in the matter; and, it being now late, the party broke
up, each one feeling glad that a good thing had been done
on a good day.</p>

<h2>THE AISLES</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">M</span>r. Beeland accompanied his two friends some distance
on their way home.</p>

<p>"I remember noticing," said Mr. Acres, "that the pews
of your two parishioners very much blocked up the <i>centre aisle</i>
of the church; their removal will much widen the aisle, which
will be a great improvement."</p>

<p>"Forgive me for correcting you," said Mr. Ambrose, "there
can be no such thing as a <i>centre aisle</i>. You are speaking of
the centre <i>alley</i> or <i>passage</i>. The word <i>aisle</i><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> can only refer to
the wing of a building, and it always denotes that portion of a
church which runs laterally north or south of the nave or
chancel. I see, Mr. Beeland, you have some work to do in
that aisle of yours before your church will be in good order."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my greatest remaining difficulty. I have
observed that those of the congregation who occupy that
aisle are far less attentive and devotional than the rest; and
the reasons are obvious. They are cut off from the main
portion of the church, not only by the high backs of the
existing pews, and by the hat and cloak rails which run from
pillar to pillar, but also by needless masses of modern masonry.
Moreover, they can see nothing of that part of the church
which is sacred to the most solemn offices of our worship.
Then, again, what the people <i>do see</i> is enough to divert all
devotional thought and feeling from any but the <i>most</i> seriously
and religiously disposed."</p>

<p>"You mean the hideous heathen monument which occupies the
east end of the aisle. If I remember rightly, it is a sort of monstrous
Roman altar, with four huge bull's heads at each corner."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]  </span></p>

<p>"Yes; it is in the centre of a mortuary chapel, once belonging
to a family named Bullock, and their frightful crest, in
gigantic proportions, is the one object on which the eyes of at
least a third of our congregation must rest, if they open their
eyes at all. I can hardly conceive any thing more calculated
to deaden the fervour of Christian worship than an object like
this placed before the gaze of the worshipper. Much as I
object to the bare walls of Dissenting meeting-houses, and the
many-altared aisles of Roman Catholic churches, I believe
neither are so distracting to the minds of the congregation
generally as are the mortuary chapels, with their uncouth
<i>adornments</i>, which occupy so large a space in the aisles of many
of our own churches. Unfortunately, this chapel now belongs
to a young man who has recently seceded to the Church of
Rome, and he will neither allow me to appropriate for the use
of the parishioners any of the space we so much need, nor will
he consent to have the unsightly monument removed to a less
conspicuous place."</p>

<p>"The bitter hostility to wards the Church of their baptism,
and the utter absence of Christian sympathy in good works of
this nature, which characterize so many of those who have
fallen away from our Communion, is indeed most deplorable.
But even if your unreasonable and narrow-hearted parishioner
will oppose all improvement in that part of the aisle which&mdash;stolen
from God and His people&mdash;he claims as his own private
property, there is much you can do, when you set about your
work of restoration, to make that part of the church less isolated
than at present. At least, you can remove much of the useless
wood and masonry which now separate the aisle from the
nave."</p>

<p>"I propose also to re-open the ancient hagioscope in
the south wall of the chancel, by which means the people in
the aisle will once more gain a view of the altar, and be
enabled to see and hear the priest when officiating there."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell me, Mr. Beeland," said Mr. Acres,
"what are <i>hagioscopes</i><a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>? I never remember having heard the
word before."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]  </span></p>

<p>"You probably have heard them called by their more common
name of <i>squints</i>. They are openings in the north or
south walls of the chancel, or perhaps more commonly in
the walls supporting the chancel arch, and are intended to give
a view of the altar to those who are worshipping in the aisles.
They are to be found in most old churches, but they have
commonly, as in our case, been bricked up. It is manifestly
very desirable that in all cases they should be restored, not
only on account of their architectural beauty, but also for their
practical utility in the services of the Church."</p>

<p>The party then separated, and the Vicar of Droneworth took
back to his parish a lighter heart than he had known for many
a day.</p>

<h2>THE TRANSEPTS</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"M</span>uch of the objection which you have expressed to
the prevailing arrangement of the aisles," said Mr.
Acres, continuing the conversation with his Vicar, "seems to
me to apply also to that of the transepts&mdash;I believe that is the
proper name for those portions of a church which extend in a
<i>transverse</i> direction north and south?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Vicar; "and the remedies for the evil are
in both cases nearly the same. Great inconvenience often
arises from the exclusive character of the parclose. I would
have the solid part of this made lower, and the upper part more
light and open."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my friend, but I am ignorant as to what you
mean by the word <i>parclose</i>."</p>

<p>"I refer now to the screen which encloses the chancel on the
north and south sides; but I believe the word may apply to
any screen in the church. By means of these screens, however,
the persons in the transepts are needlessly excluded from
a view of the altar."</p>

<p>"Yes; but the change in them which you suggest would not
fully meet the difficulty, even if a squint or hagioscope should
also be provided."</p>

<p>"I see that," said the Vicar; "and for that reason I would,
as a rule, only have those portions of the transepts nearest the
chancel fitted with permanent seats. On special occasions
chairs could be placed in the back parts; or, perhaps, the
whole of the transepts might be given up to the children of
the parochial schools, the elder children, who could best understand
the nature of the services, being placed in the front."</p>

<p>"A very proper arrangement, indeed, I should think, for
all of them would be able at least to <i>hear</i>, and they would<span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]  </span>
be conveniently placed for assisting in the musical parts of the
service. It has often struck me as the refinement of cruelty to
place these children in the remote damp corners of country
churches, where too often they are to be found; or, worse still,
in the topmost galleries of city churches, where the air they
breathe is heated and impure. In both cases there is a manifest
unconcern as well for the temporal as for the spiritual
welfare of these little ones of Christ's flock."</p>

<p>"To whatever use, however, they may be applied, or even if
they are entirely unappropriated, so far as regards affording
accommodation for the congregation, I would, by all means,
wherever practicable, retain the transeptal arrangement of our
churches, not only as being the most ornamental form of
structure, but as preserving in the entire building the distinct
form of the <i>Cross</i>; and as symbolizing in the gathering together
of each congregation of Christ's Church&mdash;which is <i>His
Body</i>, that Body itself. Thus the nave represents the body,
the transepts the outstretched arms, and the chancel&mdash;being
the most excellent part of the church&mdash;the head<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of our Lord.
Some perhaps might think it fanciful, but to me there is something
very solemn and beautiful in the idea, not only of the
church's whole fabric assuming these symbolic forms, but also
of the united prayers and praises of the congregation making,
as it were, in their very sound <i>the sign of the Cross</i>."</p>

<p>"I think so too. And to my mind it has always seemed
that the grand symbolism which looks through, as it were, the
<i>whole</i> fabric of the church, and the <i>whole</i> congregation therein
assembled, was formerly much marred in our churches, when
there were <i>many</i> altars, dedicated to <i>many</i> saints, instead
of the <i>one</i> altar, which we now only retain, dedicated to the
<i>one Head</i> of the Christian Church."</p>

<p>"Yes; and your remark, of course, applies specially to the
<i>transepts</i> about which we were speaking, since even in our
country churches every transept had its separate altar, the
<i>piscina</i> attached to which is still to be found in almost every
old church."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_223" id="Pg_223"></a>[Pg 223]  </span></p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mr. Acres, "that beautiful Gothic niche
in our south transept which you recently restored is a <i>piscina</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. The piscina was always placed on the south
side of the altar, and it was used chiefly as the receptacle for
the water used in cleansing the sacred vessels, or for that used
by the priest in washing his hands<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. It is to be found in our
earliest Norman churches, and evidently dates from the time
of their erection. There is often a <i>shelf</i> placed over the basin
of the piscina, which was used as a <i>credence</i><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>."</p>

<p>"We heard much about the credence-table some time since,"
interrupted the Squire, "when there was a suit in law about
this and some other matters; but I confess I am still ignorant
as to the purpose of the credence-table."</p>

<p>"It is usually a small table, or, when forming part of the
piscina, a shelf, on which the elements intended for use at the
Eucharist are placed before their consecration. Just before
the prayer for the <i>church militant</i> in the Communion Service
there is this direction: 'The priest shall <i>then</i> place upon the
table (i.e. the altar) so much bread and wine as he shall think
sufficient.' Now, you see, it would be very inconvenient, and
a sad interruption of that part of the service, to bring these from
a distant part of the church. The ancient custom, therefore, of
placing the elements on the credence-table at the commencement
of the service is most convenient for the proper observance of
this rubric. And so, although the credence has only been
preserved as an interesting relic, or ornament in other parts of
the church, in the chancel it has been preserved or restored<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>,
as being still a most useful and important part of the furniture
of the church."</p>

<p>Having now arrived at the vicarage-gate, the two friends
bade each other good-night.</p>

<h2>THE CHANCEL SCREEN</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">P</span>erhaps, gentle reader (all readers are supposed to be
"gentle,"&mdash;they <i>ought</i> to be), if you live in a retired
village, you will find that in the course of many years, your
village annals present little or nothing worthy of record, as
matter of general interest or importance; you will, therefore,
understand how that the past six years at the little village of
St. Catherine's have been so uneventful as to be noticed only
by a blank in our narrative. But now, on this twenty-sixth day
of June, in the year 1866, an event of no common interest in
a country parish is about to take place.</p>

<p>Since their first meeting, four years ago, at the vicarage of
Droneworth, a close intimacy had grown up between the
families of Mr. Acres and his neighbour Sir John Adamley;
the upright integrity and manly candour which marked both
their characters soon begat a deep mutual respect, which, in
course of time, ripened into a warm friendship, now about to
be sealed in the marriage of the Baronet's eldest son Egbert
with Mr. Acres' eldest daughter Constance.</p>

<p>The place is all astir betimes. Early in the morning a
merry peal is sounding from the old church tower, and many
hands are busy in decorating with flowers and evergreens
arches placed at intervals between the church and the Hall. It
is by no order of the Squire or his steward that these arches&mdash;erected
at no slight cost of money and labour&mdash;are put up;
they are the spontaneous expression of the interest which the
villagers themselves take in the day's rejoicing. There are
William Hardy, Robert Atkinson, Mr. Dole, even old Matthew
and his grandson, and indeed half the village, as busy as bees
in and out of the church, vying with each other in their endeavour
to make every thing look bright and joyful. Every one<span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]  </span>
has put on something gay and cheerful, purchased specially for
the occasion; there is the light of honest gladness on every
face; and now that the children with their baskets of fresh
flowers stand ranged on either side of the pathway that leads
from the main road to the lich-gate, the scene is one of the
most picturesque that can be imagined....</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Ambrose particularly wish that the first part of
the service should take place near the <i>chancel screen</i>?" inquires
Sir John.</p>

<p>"Yes," answers the Squire; "it is always the custom here,
and I think you will afterwards acknowledge that this arrangement
is very fitting and appropriate; and, indeed, adds not a
little to the impressiveness of the ceremony."</p>

<p>"I can quite imagine that; but what authority has the Vicar
for the practice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is very plain. If you just look at your Prayer
Book, you will see this rubric at the commencement of the
Marriage Service: 'At the time appointed for the solemnization
of matrimony, the persons to be married shall come into the
<i>body of the church</i> with their friends and neighbours, and <i>there</i>
standing, the priest shall say'&mdash;then follows the address to the
congregation assembled, and the rest of the service, till the priest
pronounces the first blessing; and after that, the priests and
clerks, 'going to the Lord's Table,' are directed to say or sing
one of the Psalms, and it is evidently intended that the newly-married
persons should accompany them, for when the Psalm
is ended they are mentioned as 'kneeling before the Lord's
Table.' This procession to the altar of course loses much of
its meaning and impressiveness when there is no celebration
of Holy Communion. But, then, this ought not to be omitted,
except in very extreme cases."</p>

<p>"I quite see now that Mr. Ambrose is following the rule of
the Church. I certainly never read the directions in the Service
before. I suppose, however, there is no particular part of the
body of the church named?"</p>

<p>"No; I believe it is only ancient custom which decides
upon the chancel screen; it is, too, the most convenient part
of the church for this purpose." ...</p>

<p>Why is it that all those young eyes are so bright with love,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]  </span>
as from each ready hand falls the gay flowers at the feet of the
happy pair? Why is each knee bent during <i>every</i> prayer in
that solemn service? And, now, when the hands of Mr.
Ambrose rest on the heads of Constance and her husband,
as he pronounces over them the last blessing of the Church, why
does the deep <i>Amen</i> sound from <i>every</i> lip? Why is there that
breathless silence as those happy ones kneel before the altar
to bind themselves yet more closely together, and to God, in
Holy Communion? And now, as they come forth from God's
House, how is it that there is no faltering voice in all that
assembly as the glad shout of Christian joy rings up through
the air to heaven? I'll tell you. It is because the priest and
the Squire have ever recognized their joint duties in that
parish; because Constance has been a sister of charity and
mercy among the poor; because they have striven with all
their might to do the work God gave them to do; and now
they have their reward in the hearty affection and respect of
all their neighbours.</p>

<p>There were but two exceptions to this general manifestation
of good feeling among the villagers, and they were the last
evil growth of the old Anabaptist schism in the parish. At
the same time that Egbert and Constance were breathing their
mutual vows beneath the old chancel screen of St Catherine's,
William Strike and Sally Sowerby were being "married" by
Mr. Gallio at the new register-office at Townend....</p>

<p>"There is something very touching," said the Squire to Mr.
Ambrose, as they walked back together to the Hall, "in that
old custom preserved in our village of hanging a white glove
on the chancel screen<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. That was the very glove my dear
Mary wore when she promised to be the wife of Edward
Markland, and poor Edward himself placed it there. I saw
Constance's eyes fill with tears to-day as she ventured to give
one look at the sad memento."</p>

<p>"The custom is fast dying out, and only survives in a few
rural parishes. Indeed, the very screens themselves have, you<span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]  </span>
know, in most churches been swept away<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. The finer carving
is often to be found worked up into pews, and the large
timbers have been used in building galleries. Where these
screens were made of stone<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>, they have generally been preserved
unharmed. In some cases, alas! people have not been
contented with demolishing the screen, but have actually in
their place built a gallery<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> for a family pew, extending all
across the front of the chancel, but I am thankful to say such
instances are very rare."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell me the origin of the chancel screen?"</p>

<p>"It was formerly called the rood screen, or rood gallery, and
where the rood has been restored, it is still properly so called.
The Gospel used to be read from this gallery, and sometimes
the psalms were sung there by the priests and choristers. The
custom of reading the Gospel from this position was evidently
intended to express a special respect for this portion of God's
Word; and so, for the same reason, now the Gospel is read
from the <i>north</i> side of the chancel, whilst the Epistle is read
from the south. The <i>rood</i><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, which consisted of a crucifix with
the figure of the Blessed Virgin on one side, and of St. John on
the other, was placed at the top of the screen. Over this, and
between the chancel arch and the roof, the wall was painted,
the subject usually being the Doom, or representation of the
Last Judgment. To replace this, it would seem that, at the
Reformation, the Commandments were ordered to be painted
at the east end of the church."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]  </span></p>

<p>"You think, then," said the Squire, "that the order in the
canons does not refer to the east end of the <i>chancel</i>?"</p>

<p>"It is a disputed point, but <i>I</i> think not. Had the chancel
been intended, I think it would have been so stated. Besides,
it was ordered that they should be so placed that the 'people
could best see and read the same,' and certainly they could not
do the latter if they were painted at the east end of the chancel.
Indeed, I regard that as the least convenient and appropriate
place in the whole church for them. If we have them any where,
the east end of the nave or aisles is the best place for them;
but, really, the need to have them at all is now passed away,
as those who can read, can read the Commandments in their
Bibles and Prayer Books; and for those who cannot, it is useless
placing them on the walls of the church<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. However, it is far
better to have the Commandments over the chancel arch than
the <i>royal arms</i>. It is wonderful how silly people become
when they have a superstitious dread of superstition. For
instance, I know a church where the congregation were offended
by an old painting in the church, the subject of which was at
least calculated to inspire solemn thoughts, yet could be contented
that the most conspicuous object in the church should be
a hideous representation of the royal arms, with this sentence
below it in large characters: 'Mrs. Jemima Diggs, widow,
gave this painting of the Queen's arms, A.D. 1710<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.' I should
like to know what there is in that to remind us that we are
in the House of God?"</p>

<h2>THE CHANCEL</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"I</span> hope you and my friend Mr. Beeland here are now
working harmoniously together at Droneworth," said
Mr. Ambrose to Sir John Adamley, as with Mr. Acres and the
Vicar of Droneworth they were enjoying a pleasant afternoon
stroll in the gardens of the Hall.</p>

<p>"Well, I think we must say yes and no to that, for though
we have never had any difference of opinion respecting the
restoration of our church since the evening when I first had
the pleasure of meeting you&mdash;and, indeed, I am proud, and we
are all proud, of our renovated and beautiful church&mdash;yet
there is one point on which we cannot quite agree. You see
I am Lay Rector, and though I have long ago given up my old
selfish idea about pews, and only claim the space in the
church which I really want to occupy, yet I do consider that,
as the chancel belongs to me, I have a right to a place <i>there</i>
for my family and servants, as well as for myself. But, unfortunately,
Mr. Beeland thinks otherwise."</p>

<p>"The chancel is furnished with handsome oak stalls for the
choristers, I believe; as every chancel ought to be. You propose,
if I understand you, to remove the choristers, and to
occupy the stalls for yourselves and servants?"</p>

<p>"I think I have a right to do so."</p>

<p>"The right is very doubtful. The position of a lay rector
is altogether an anomalous one; but the duty and the privilege
connected with it are, to my mind, definite and plain enough.
The duty is to keep out the wind and water from the chancel,
the privilege is to receive the great tithes of the parish. Now,
of course, this privilege and duty were originally never intended
to be associated with other than a spiritual office. The tithes
were for the support of the parish priest, and in return for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]  </span>
them, there was laid upon him not only the spiritual supervision
of the parish, but also the duty of keeping the <i>shell</i> of
that portion of the church which was occupied by him and the
assisting clerks sound and entire. Now, of course, the rector,
being a priest, had a right to his proper place in the chancel;
and I by no means deny that the lay rector succeeds to the
same right; but my belief is that the right (if any) extends <i>no
farther than himself</i>. He represents the clerical rector, who
certainly could only claim a right to a seat for <i>himself</i>, and it
is my opinion the layman can claim no more. But, my dear
sir, this is surely a case where higher considerations than
mere legal rights should have influence. Even if you have the
right, ought you not to waive it? For you cannot doubt that
the chancel was never built to supply seats for the Squire's
family, but for the priest and those whose office it is specially
to assist him in <i>leading</i> the prayers and praises of the congregation.
No church is properly ordered where the chancel
stalls are not occupied by the choir; and you can only rightly
occupy a place there as one of them. So I venture to advise
you to follow the example of our friend Mr. Acres, and next
Sunday put on a surplice, and take your place as a member
of the choir, for you have a good bass voice, which would be
of great assistance there."</p>

<p>"So you really think my claims as a lay rector should come
down to this?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I think they should come <i>up</i> to this, for your highest,
as well as most fitting office as a lay rector, is to assist in his
duties the Vicar of your parish."</p>

<p>"Well, I will think about that. You have studied these
matters much more deeply than I have, and you always have
the best of the argument. But I have something more to say.
I should like to have your opinion as to the proper arrangement
and furniture of the whole of the chancel<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>, for ours has
not yet been completed, and I have undertaken to finish it."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]  </span></p>

<p>"I will gladly give you my opinion on the subject. Of
course, the altar should be the central and principal object
in the church. For this reason, the east of the chancel should
be the highest part, but for evident reasons the whole of the
chancel should be higher than the nave<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. There should be a
marked difference between the chancel&mdash;or choir, and the
sanctuary&mdash;or space immediately surrounding the altar; a
difference which had its type in the 'Holy Place' and the
'Holy of Holies' of the Jewish temple. The <i>lectern</i>&mdash;or desk,
from which the lessons are read, and the <i>faldstool</i>&mdash;or Litany
desk, may be either just without or within the chancel screen.
The <i>sedilia</i><a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>&mdash;a stone recess for the seats of the officiating clergy,
with the <i>piscina</i><a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>&mdash;should be on the south side, and the <i>credence</i><a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
<i>table</i> may be on the north or south side of the altar. The <i>reredos</i><a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>,
at the east end of the chancel, should be the most costly and
elaborate part of the church, as it is connected with the most
dignified portion of the building. Its most prominent feature
should be the symbol of our salvation, and whatever adornment
is employed, it should have distinct reference to the 'sacrifice
of the death of Christ.' <i>Empty niches</i> should here and every
where be carefully avoided; for they have little beauty and no
meaning. Without their tenants, they are ridiculous forms of ornamentation,
for the corbel&mdash;or bracket, has no meaning unless it
is intended to support a figure, nor its canopy, unless intended
to shelter and protect one. I have seen slabs containing epitaphs
and the armorial bearings of private persons, as well as the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]  </span>
royal shield, substituted for a proper reredos, but this is a sad
profanation<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. There is one thing worse; and that is engraving
armorial bearings on the sacred vessels. The <i>prayer desk</i><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
should form part of the choir stalls, and look in the same direction;
this desk should not face the congregation, as the priest
does not preach the prayers <i>to</i> the congregation, but says the
prayers <i>with</i> them. When the Absolution is said, the case is
different, and the propriety of the change of posture and position
is evident. This is directly addressed <i>to</i> the congregation,
and to be 'pronounced by the priest <i>standing</i>.' So in the
Communion Office the Priest is directed to <i>stand up, and,
turning himself to the people, pronounce the Absolution</i>."</p>

<p>"I quite acknowledge the justness of what you say on these
points, and shall gladly avail myself of your further counsel;
specially I shall be grateful for your advice respecting the construction
of the <i>altar</i>, and providing its proper furniture: but I
have now already trespassed so long on your time, that I must
only ask you to explain one thing more, and that is the meaning
of the two little hollow square places in the north wall of
our chancel."</p>

<p>"They formerly were closets, and had doors, no doubt, of
carved oak. They are commonly called <i>almeries</i>, and are to be
found in all old churches, their use in the chancel being to hold<span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]  </span>
the sacred vessels used at the altar; even where they can no
longer be utilized, they ought to be preserved as objects of
interest<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>."</p>

<h2>THE ALTAR</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">I</span>t was late in the evening before the other guests had left
the Hall, and our four friends sat down together in the
library, without fear of interruption, to continue the conversation
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>"I should like you to tell me, Mr. Ambrose," said Sir
John, "whether you consider that the word <i>altar</i> is properly
applied to a table made of wood."</p>

<p>"Oh, most certainly it is. The term is equally applicable,
whether the altar be made of wood or stone. No doubt stone
was the material first used<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>, yet at so early a period as the
building of the tabernacle, we read that God commanded
Moses to make an altar of <i>wood</i><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. In the earliest days of the
Christian Church the altars were, probably without exception,
made of wood; but afterwards it became the practice to erect
them of stone, and from the sixth<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> to the sixteenth century this
rule was all but universal."</p>

<p>"How is the change to be accounted for?"</p>

<p>"During the persecutions of the early Christians under the
heathen Emperors of Rome, they resorted, as you are aware, to
the subterranean catacombs there, as the only places where
they could, in comparative safety, hold their religious services.
Here the stone altar-tombs of those who had suffered martyrdom
offered the most convenient and fitting altars for the
celebration of the Holy Eucharist. In after times, when the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]  </span>
Church was prosperous and at peace, the remembrance of these
altar-tombs not only suggested the material for the Christian
altar, but also the custom of erecting it over the relics of saints
and martyrs. This custom of building the altar over the bones
of martyrs (which is still continued in the Roman Church,
but which has for many years ceased to be the practice in
our own), is, moreover, supposed to have reference to that
mysterious vision in the Revelation of St. John, which you will
remember he thus describes: 'When the Lamb had opened
the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were
slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they
held<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.'</p>

<p>"The use of stone instead of wood was, no doubt, adopted
also for other reasons than the one I have stated. Stone altars
were less liable to desecration; they possess, too, a symbolism
of their own, representing both the <i>incarnation</i> and <i>entombment</i>
of our Blessed Lord<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. The scriptural symbol of a Rock<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>, as
representing our Lord, might appear to be more evidently connected
with the stone than the wooden altar, but this symbol
must always be associated with the idea of altar, of whatever
material it is made. The wooden altar, on the other hand,
may seem to refer more directly to the <i>institution</i> of the <i>Lord's
Supper</i>; and the altar candlesticks have, of course, a peculiar and
very manifest appropriateness when the altar is so considered."</p>

<p>"But surely, my friend, the word <i>table</i> seems to be here
exactly applicable."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it is; but you must not try to separate things
which are inseparable. Every altar is a table, though every
table is not an altar. Both terms are correct, but the one
must not be supposed to exclude the other; and it would be
strange indeed if, having a <i>priest</i> and an <i>oblation</i><a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, the church
should be without an <i>altar</i>. The top slab of the altar is the
table<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>, whether it is made of wood or stone. Where this slab is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]  </span>
of stone, it has from early times been considered to represent
the stone rolled to the mouth of the sepulchre of our Lord. In
the Greek Church the <i>seal</i> that was set on the stone<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> is represented
by the consecrated wafer; in the Roman Church this
seal is represented by the small square stone let into the centre
of the altar table<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. In the primitive Church there was but one
altar in each church, but afterwards it became a custom to
erect many others, dedicated to as many saints and martyrs.
This was the custom in our own Church&mdash;just as it is still
in the Roman Church&mdash;before Queen Elizabeth ordered all
altars to be removed in every church, except the <i>high altar</i>,
which is the only one we now retain; and, for my part, I certainly
wish for no other. But at the same time <i>all stone altars</i>
were ordered to be removed, and then altars of wood were
once more placed in almost every church. I am sorry to say
the old stone altars were broken up and desecrated. Some
few, however, of them escaped<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, and many more have since
that time been erected. There are probably hundreds of stone
altars to be found in our cathedrals, college chapels, and parish
churches, and I don't suppose (though some seem to do so)
that people attach more superstitious meaning to them than to
the most modern oaken Communion table. But, as I said
before, to my mind it is indifferent whether the altar be of
wood or stone."</p>

<p>"I should like your opinion about the proper furniture for
the altar."</p>

<p>"First, with regard to its <i>covering</i>: the canon directs that
the altar shall be covered with 'a carpet of silk, or other decent
stuff' on ordinary occasions, and with 'a fair linen cloth' at<span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]  </span>
the time of the celebration of Holy Communion. This order
allows considerable liberty as to colour and pattern; but it
appears to imply that it should be as rich as the circumstances
of each case will allow<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. Where cloths of more than one
colour are used, these five&mdash;in accordance with very ancient
practice&mdash;are commonly employed as specially adapted to the
different seasons of the Christian year: <i>white</i>, at Christmas
and certain other festivals, as emblematical of purity; <i>red</i>, as
representing the blood of martyrs, and at Pentecost, as emblematic
of the fiery tongues; <i>green</i>, for general use, as the prevailing
colour of nature, and a sort of middle colour between the
rest in use; <i>violet</i> and <i>black</i> as colours of mourning."</p>

<p>"But, surely, this variety is <i>unnecessary</i>?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly. Nevertheless, where they can conveniently
be had, they are <i>appropriate</i>, and teach their own
lesson. It was not <i>necessary</i> to put a cloth of black on the
altar at Droneworth when your father died two years since;
and I am doubtful whether Mr. Beeland was quite right in
doing so. But surely if you thought it was right for him to do
this at the funeral of a mere mortal man, you cannot say
that it is wrong to use a black altar-cloth on <i>Good Friday</i>;
and, of course, the same argument applies to all the rest. With
regard to the custom in some places of covering half the church
with black for a month, because some rich man has died in the
parish&mdash;I say plainly that I regard that as next to impiety and
profanation."</p>

<p>"I see the justness of your words. What do you say to
<i>cushions</i> on the altar?"</p>

<p>"Say! <i>they ought never to be there</i>. I can imagine nothing more
out of place. I have often wondered for what purpose they could
originally have been put there. They are certainly not required,
nor yet convenient as a rest for the Altar Service Book. It is
too shocking to suppose they were intended to enable the priest
to rest his arms and head softly on God's altar! I have sometimes<span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]  </span>
fancied I see their origin in an old custom observed in
the Roman Church of placing the two lambs, whose wool was
used for making the palls<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> with which the Bishop of Rome
invests his archbishops with their archiepiscopal authority,
on <i>two richly embroidered cushions, one of which was placed
on the north, the other on the south side of the altar</i>; but I know
not. A <i>desk</i> of brass or oak is convenient to support the
office-book, and <i>two candles</i> are ordered to be placed on the
altar."</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir, I am told that is a very <i>Romish</i>
custom."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir John, and so it is a very Romish custom to say
the Lord's Prayer, and it is a very Hindoo custom for a wife
to love her husband with a special devotion; but we shall not,
for either reason, be disposed to blame either custom. The
thing with us, like every thing else, is either right or wrong <i>in
itself</i>, independent of the use of any other Church. But it so
happens that this is the very reverse to a Romish custom, for
these two candles were ordered to be placed on the altar in
direct opposition to the custom of the Roman Catholic
Church<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. Nothing can be more expressive, and utterly unobjectionable,
than the symbolism of these <i>two</i> candles (of course,
it is not <i>necessary</i> that they should be <i>lighted</i> in order to preserve
their emblematic meaning), and I should be very sorry to see
this simple symbolism broken into by the introduction of more
than two lights upon the altar<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. I have not by any means<span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]   </span>
mentioned all that is required for the service of the altar; I
have only spoken of its ordinary furniture. That which is
specially required for the Eucharistic services is, doubtless,
already provided in your church."</p>

<p>"Before we say good-night," said Mr. Acres, "let me ask
you one question indirectly connected with this subject. I
notice that many of my neighbours receive the consecrated
bread <i>on the palm of the hand</i>, some holding both hands in
the form of a cross. I suppose this is in accordance with your
instruction: I should like to know the reason for it. Where
there are high altar-rails&mdash;which I much object to, and which,
of course, are altogether unnecessary when the chancel screen
is properly arranged, as with us&mdash;this custom would be very
inconvenient."</p>

<p>"The short rail, north and south, for the use of the aged and
infirm, is certainly all that is required. As regards the manner
of receiving the sacred element, to which you refer, I certainly
have recommended it, and for these reasons: it is much more
convenient both for the priest and the communicant; it avoids
all danger of any portion of the bread falling on the floor; and
it is most in accordance with the rubric, which directs that the
minister shall deliver the communion <i>into</i> the hands of the
recipients."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I consider your reasons as amply sufficient,
and I see no possible objection to the custom."</p>

<h2>THE ORGAN-CHAMBER.</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"A</span>nd so, Harry, my boy, you have really made up your
mind to be a chorister?" said Mr. Ambrose to old
Matthew's grandson, one Sunday morning.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you please, sir," was his reply. "Grandfather says
he should like me to be one."</p>

<p>"And you wish it yourself, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. You are a well-conducted boy, and God has
given you a good musical voice, so we shall be very pleased
to have you amongst us. But you must never forget that
there is not only a high honour, but also a very solemn
responsibility connected with the office of a chorister. Always
remember, then, that you are in a very especial way <i>God's
servant</i>, that His eye is upon you, and that He will expect you
to do your duty in the <i>very best way you possibly can</i>. You
must <i>sing and give praise with the best member that you have</i><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>&mdash;that
is, you must devote to God's praise and glory the very
best service you can render. You are a little boy to talk to
about setting a good example to a congregation, composed for
the most part of persons so much older than yourself, but yet that
is one of your chief duties. When you are in the choir, the
eyes of all the congregation are upon you, and they should not
only <i>hear</i> you singing as well as you can, and so be led themselves
to join heartily in the musical parts of the service, but also <i>at
all other times</i> they should <i>see</i> you reverent and devout in your
conduct; and be sure, my boy, this good and serious behaviour
of yours will have its influence upon others, though perhaps
they may be hardly conscious of it. Now there is enough in
this to make you very serious, but yet the thought that God<span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]  </span>
permits you in your young years thus to help in promoting His
glory, and to be such a blessing to your fellow-creatures, should
make you very happy and very thankful to Him." ...</p>

<p>Before the commencement of the Morning Prayers little
Harry was solemnly admitted a member of the choir. The
ceremony was a very simple, but yet a very solemn one. On
this occasion the usual order of entering the church was reversed.
Mr. Ambrose came first, then the eight senior members
of the choir, then the seven boy choristers, and last came
Harry. All wore their surplices except Harry, and he carried
his new little surplice on his arm. During the procession
solemn music was played on the organ. As soon as it
ceased, all knelt down to say their private prayers, Harry
kneeling on a cushion prepared for him at the entrance to the
chancel. It was the custom at St. Catherine's for all the congregation
to stand up when the priest and choir entered; which
custom, besides being a mark of respect for His presence to
whom they were about to dedicate their worship and service,
had this advantage&mdash;that it induced all to say their private
prayers at the same time, and thus avoided much confusion;
it tended also to prepare the mind <i>at once</i> to enter into the
spirit of the <i>public</i> service.</p>

<p>After a short pause, Mr. Ambrose read a portion of the
third chapter of the first book of Samuel. He then addressed
Harry in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henry, before I proceed to admit you a member of the
choir of this church, you must promise, before God and this
congregation, that in the solemn office on which you are about
to enter, you will always strive above all things to promote His
glory. Do you so promise?"</p>

<p>Little Harry, in a timid, trembling voice, answered, "I do
so promise."</p>

<p>The Vicar and choir then sang, alternately, the following
sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Priest.</i>&mdash;"Our help is in the name of the Lord;"</p>

<p><i>Choir.</i>&mdash;"Who made heaven and earth."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"O Lord, bless and keep this Thy servant;"</p>

<p><i>C.</i>&mdash;"Who putteth his trust in Thee."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Accept his service in this Thy House;"<span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]  </span></p>

<p><i>C.</i>&mdash;"And make the voice of Thy praise to be glorious."</p>

<p><i>P.</i>&mdash;"Lord, hear our prayer;"</p>

<p><i>C.</i>&mdash;"And let our crying come unto Thee."</p>

<p>Mr. Ambrose then read these verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of
the holy place&mdash;also the Levites, which were the singers,
all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons
and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having
cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end
of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests
sounding with trumpets:&mdash;it came even to pass as the trumpeters
and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in
praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their
voice with the trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of
music, and praised the Lord, saying, For He is good; for His
mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a
cloud, even the house of the Lord; so that the priests could not
stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the
Lord had filled the house of God<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>."</p>

<p>The choir then sang, "Glory be to Thee, O God," during
which time the senior choir boy led little Harry into the
middle of the choir, where he knelt down on a cushion prepared
for him.</p>

<p>Mr. Ambrose then said this prayer: "O most merciful
Father, before whom 'Samuel ministered, being a child, girded
with a linen ephod,' give, we pray Thee, to this Thy youthful
servant such gifts as shall enable him to sing Thy praise, and
promote Thy glory in this Thy Temple, and grace to worship
Thee acceptably in the beauty of holiness, and to adorn the
doctrine of Christ his Saviour in all things. Amen."</p>

<p>Harry then stood up, and as Mr. Ambrose placed on him
his little surplice, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henry, I robe you in this surplice in token that you are
now set apart to be a chorister, and, together with those around
you, to assist in the high and glorious work of leading the
praises of God in this church: let the whiteness of this robe
always remind you of that purity which should mark the
service you here offer up to God. I pray you never, either here<span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>
or elsewhere, to disgrace this robe of your solemn office. What
you sing with your lips believe in your heart, and what you
believe in your heart fulfil in your life; and may God so bless
and protect you, that when this life is ended, you may join
that angel choir who in robes of white sing before the Throne,
'Glory to God and to the Lamb for ever and ever.' Amen."</p>

<p>The new chorister then took his place in the choir, whilst
the organ almost thundered the following chorus, in which all
joined:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Great and Mighty God, with angels and archangels we
laud and magnify Thy glorious name. Amen."</p>

<p>The usual morning service then proceeded. Many eyes
were fixed on the earnest, thoughtful little face that appeared
for the first time in the choir; and with not a little pardonable
pride did old Matthew watch the hearty efforts of his
grandson to fulfil the promise he had just made.</p>

<p>It had long been a custom for the Vicar and Mr. Mendles,
the organist, to partake of a late meal at the Hall when their
Sunday duties were ended; and on this Sunday evening the
Squire accompanied them home from church.</p>

<p>"Our little friend," said he, "will be quite an acquisition to
the choir; he has a very sweet voice."</p>

<p>"Yes, he has," replied the Vicar; "and what is of no less
importance, he is sure to conduct himself well. But, for that
matter, I have no reason to complain of any one of our choir;
for, thanks to Mr. Mendles, and to their own sense of propriety,
I don't believe there is a better conducted choir in any
parish than ours."</p>

<p>"That is very much owing to your allowing no men to be
there who are not communicants."</p>

<p>"That's a good rule, no doubt, and accounts, perhaps, more
than any thing for their reverent behaviour. You well know,
Mr. Mendles, there was little reverence enough once."</p>

<p>"The great difficulty," said Mr. Mendles, "is to persuade
the choir that they should sing to God, <i>with</i> the congregation,
not <i>to</i> the congregation. I strive both to learn myself, and to
teach them, that our singing should be <i>worship</i>, not the mere
exhibition of <i>talent</i>, and that we ought to rejoice when the congregation
<i>join in</i>, not when they only <i>listen to</i> our hymns and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]  </span>
chants. I believe we have now learnt the lesson, and are the
happier for it."</p>

<p>"And we all feel the benefit of that lesson too," said the
Vicar, "for whereas formerly nothing but flashy tunes which
enabled them to show off their own talent would please the
choir, we have now, thank God, a solemn and devotional character
in the music of our liturgical services, and a joyful gladness
in the music of our hymns&mdash;equally far removed from
levity and from mournfulness&mdash;which, with our praises and our
prayers, seem to float up our very souls to heaven."</p>

<p>"I think we must attribute the success of our musical services
in some measure to the new position of the organ, must
we not, Mr. Mendles?" said the Squire.</p>

<p>"Most certainly. There can be no doubt that the most
convenient position for the organ-chamber is either on the
north or south side of the chancel; or, if the organ is divided,
on both sides. It is a misfortune that, as organs were but
little known when most of our old churches were erected<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>, we
find no fitting place provided for them in the original structure.
There is, however, no excuse for our modern architects who
are guilty of such an omission; and it is a matter of surprise to
me that they do not make the organ-chamber a feature of more
prominence and greater beauty, both externally and internally,
than they are accustomed to do."</p>

<p>"True," said the Squire; "specially as in our days the organ
is regarded as all but a necessity in every church. Certainly,
there is no musical instrument so suitable for congregational
worship, for whilst it represents all kinds of music, it exactly
realizes the description given in the account of the dedication
of the temple which Mr. Ambrose read this morning, and
brings together the cymbals and the psalteries and the harps,
and the trumpeters and the singers '<i>as one</i>.'</p>

<p>"It is a curious fact&mdash;is it not, sir?&mdash;that whereas the presence<span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]   </span>
of organs in our churches used to be the source of great
offence to Dissenters in this country, and has recently been
the subject of much dispute among Presbyterian Dissenters,
yet you can now hardly find a Dissenting meeting-house
of any size but can boast of its organ, and often a very good
one too. Let us hope, Mr. Vicar, that ere long they, may become
reconciled also to other things in our Church which now
they may regard with the same horror with which they once
looked upon the church organ."</p>

<h2>THE VESTRY</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">T</span>o the close friendship which existed between the Squire
and the Vicar, constantly cemented by such meetings
as we have just described, was owing, in a considerable degree,
the general harmony and goodwill which made St. Catherine's
one of the most peaceful villages in England. When, many
years ago, Mr. Ambrose first became Vicar there, he felt it
his duty to make many changes in a parish which had been
long neglected, and in a church which was almost a ruin.
His labours were then regarded with much suspicion and disfavour;
but he had now been long enough resident in the
parish to live down all that hostile feeling. Nevertheless, it was
not all peace at St. Catherine's. From time to time there would
be an importation of cross-grained malcontents, who usually
succeeded in stirring up some parochial strife.</p>

<p>Such had for some time past been the laudable occupation
of William Strike and his too faithful companion, whom, by
kind permission of Mr. Gallio, the registrar, he was allowed
to call his wife. He had never promised to love her, and
she had never promised to obey him, and on these little
points each scrupulously maintained a right to act in perfect
independence of the other: nevertheless, they heartily united
in a common effort to instil into the minds of their neighbours
a feeling of hostility to wards the church; and some discord
in the parish was the natural consequence. An opportunity
offered on the morning of Easter Monday for Strike to find
a full vent for all his spleen.</p>

<p>It is a sad, sad thought, that at this season of the Christian
year, when all should be peace, the bitterness of party strife
should break up the harmony of so many parishes. But so it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>
is; and so it was at St. Catherine's; and this one man was at
the bottom of all the mischief.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to see you are going to the vestry this morning,
William," said Mr. Dole, as they met in the village street.</p>

<p>"I've as much right there as you have, I suppose," he replied;
"you're going to support the Vicar, and I'm going to
oppose him thick and thin."</p>

<p>"Peace is better than war, William."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> used to be on our side once, and I should like to
know what's made you turn round?"</p>

<p>"It would take too long to answer that question fully,
William. It will be enough if I tell you that where I thought I
knew most, I found myself all wrong; and the more I thought
and inquired, the more convinced I was that there could be
only one true Church committed by Christ to His Apostles and
their successors, and that to separate from that, and cause
division and schism, must be a sin. After long and prayerful
consideration, and many conversations with Mr. Ambrose on the
subject, I was convinced that the sect to which I belonged&mdash;and
you do still&mdash;was not the one true Church; and so I left it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mean to leave it; and I don't mean that the
parson shall have it all his own way in this parish."</p>

<p>Mr. Dole had in vain tried to bring his companion to a
better mind when they reached the vestry<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>. It was a small
chamber on the opposite side of the chancel to the organ<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, and
there was a sombreness about it that harmonized with the
solemn use for which it was intended. On the eastern side
were two small windows filled with stained glass, and over
them, in large letters, was the sentence, "Let thy priests be
clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints sing with joyfulness."
Between these two windows stood an oaken table, on<span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]  </span>
which was a small desk or lectern; and on this, written in
beautifully illuminated characters, were the prayers used by
Mr. Ambrose and the choir before and after the Church
services. Before the table was a small embroidered kneeling
cushion for the priest at these times. The parish chest<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>, and
two ancient chairs, all of oak and richly carved, completed the
furniture of the vestry; whilst on its walls were hung the surplices
of the choir and the vestments of the priest<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p>The meeting was called together for the double purpose of
electing churchwardens and making a church-rate, and it was soon
evident to the Vicar that Strike and his friends had come determined
on a stormy meeting. But few angry words, however,
had been spoken, when Mr. Ambrose rose and said, "My
friends, I had hoped that this meeting would have been conducted
in that spirit of Christian charity and peacefulness which
has been our custom; but as I find this is not to be the case,
I will not allow any part of God's House to be desecrated
by the exhibition of party animosity and angry strife<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. This
vestry is known to those of you who are associated with me in
conducting our religious services, as the place of holy meditation
and solemn prayer; nor are its associations less sacred
to those among you who have come here, with unquiet consciences
or troubled minds, to seek my counsel and advice.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 272] </span>
All around us here, my friends, reminds us of the service of a
God of love; so if the Demon of Discord must come into our
little parish, let this place, at least, not be the scene of his
unhallowed presence."</p>

<p>It was then proposed to adjourn the meeting to the house
of Mr. Walton; and he, having both a good heart under his
waistcoat, and a large room in his house, readily agreed to the
proposal. He was, moreover, one of the churchwardens, and,
though the village blacksmith, was a man in good circumstances,
and exercised considerable influence for good in the
parish.</p>

<p>Nothing can be less profitable than to read the "foolish
talking" which commonly characterizes a discordant vestry
meeting; we will, therefore, pass that over. The churchwardens
were re-elected, and the church-rate was carried. The Vicar
then endeavoured to pour oil upon the troubled waters by
delivering a kind and friendly address, which he ended in
these words: "Mr. Strike tells you that he will always oppose
the Church so long as it is in any way supported by the State.
But let me remind him that the Church did not receive from
the State the possessions with which she is endowed for the
maintenance of true religion in this land. Those were, for the
most part, given to our Church by pious men and women,
many hundreds of years ago; and the State, in securing these
to us, is only acting with common honesty, and doing no more
for the Church than it does for every other society&mdash;indeed,
for every person&mdash;in the country. But Mr. Strike tells you,
too, he will not give a penny for keeping up the fabric of
the Church, because he is a Dissenter. Now, my friends, to
take the <i>very lowest</i> view of the Church, and regarding her
temples only as places in which a high standard of <i>morality</i> is
set up, it is surely for the advantage of the <i>State</i>, and for the
<i>community</i>, that they should be maintained; and, therefore, <i>all</i>
should help to maintain them. 'Yes,' you say, 'but we teach
morality, too, in our little Salem Chapel at Droneworth: why
should not our meeting-house be supported as much as your
Church?' My answer is, that your Salem Chapel may any
day share the fate of the Little Bethel Meeting-House that used
to be in our parish. Besides, on your own principles, you<span class="pagenum">[Pg 273]  </span>
cannot accept State aid to keep it up. Of course I have myself
higher reasons for considering it the duty of the State to secure
the proper reparation of the fabric of our churches; but I have
only taken the lowest ground; I think, however, that even that
is firm enough to bear the weight of the whole argument. But
now, my friends, let us part in peace, and let all angry feeling
die away."</p>

<p>"The church-rates will soon be done away with altogether,
depend upon it, sir," shouted Mr. Strike, in a tone which was
an evident protestation against that spirit of peace which Mr.
Ambrose was so anxious should pervade his parish.</p>

<p>"It may be so," said the Vicar; "and if so, I believe and
pray that God will overrule even that for the benefit of His
Church."</p>

<p>And so the St. Catherine's vestry ended.</p>

<p>"I am heartily glad," said Mr. Acres to the Vicar, "that we
did not have all that row in the church to-day. Sorry as I am
to make Mr. Walton's house the scene of such discord, yet I
am sure he would far rather have it here than in the church
vestry."</p>

<p>"Any where's better than the church," said Mr. Walton, "for
such quarrels as these."</p>

<p>"By the bye," said Mr. Acres, as they both rose to depart,
"do you remember the time when the churchwardens used to
retire to the vestry before the conclusion of the service to count
up the alms? We could, you know, hear the jingling of the
money during all the later prayers of the service, and a most
indecent interruption it was. How far more seemly is your
custom of reverently presenting the alms at the altar, where it
remains till the close of the service. And I am so grateful to
you for abandoning that objectionable and most ridiculous custom
of holding the <i>plates</i> at the church door. The custom
seemed so completely to do away with the idea of almsgiving
as an <i>act of worship</i>. How many a wickedly grotesque scene
has occurred at the door of our own church, plainly showing
that many who contributed their alms simply gave them to Mr.
Walton or Mr. Acres, and least of all thought of giving them <i>to
God</i>. Nay, so anxious was dear old Lady Angelina Hilltower
and her daughter to confer upon <i>us</i> equal honour, and to avoid<span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]  </span>
any just cause of jealousy between us, that they used to create
quite a pantomime at the door whenever there was a collection,
by crossing over to put half-a-crown in each plate, making
at the same time a profound obeisance to each of us."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Acres, "I certainly am glad all that's done
away with; but I'm more glad that at last we have been able
to get rid altogether of the plates for collecting the offertory,
and to substitute <i>Bags</i>. There has been some opposition, as
you are aware; some pleaded long custom as a reason for retaining
the plates, and some, who were rather proud of their
stereotyped shilling, did not wish their benevolence to be hidden.
In fact all those who <i>did their alms before men, to be seen of
them</i>, were of course hostile to the change."</p>

<p>"I know," said the Squire, "that some were at first offended,
but none knew why. I never heard the faintest approach to a
reasonable objection to this plainly scriptural manner of <i>secret</i>
almsgiving; nor did I ever hear an argument of any weight in
favour of the plate system, except that it sometimes forces
money from unwilling contributors, and that argument is too
contemptible to notice.</p>

<h2>THE PILLARS</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">I</span>t was the day before the Festival of the Ascension, and
Ascension Day being not only one of the greatest
festivals of the Christian year, but being, moreover, the day on
which the people of St. Catherine's were used to commemorate
with great rejoicing the restoration of their now beautiful
temple, old Matthew and the Vicar were busily engaged assisting
those of the parishioners, old and young, who had the time
to spare and were sufficiently skilful, in decorating the church
with flowers and evergreens.</p>

<p>"I remember, sir, when I was a boy, we used to call those
twelve pillars that the ladies are putting the flowers on, the
<i>twelve Apostles</i>," said old Matthew.</p>

<p>"It's a common number in large churches," replied the Vicar,
"and the name for them which you remember is not an
unusual one. I remember one church where there are eleven
pillars, and the old sexton told me they stood for eleven of the
Apostles, and that there would have been twelve, but Judas was
omitted. The pillars of the church, as the chief supports of
the fabric, are said to represent the Apostles, Prophets, and
Martyrs<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. As I have often told you, there is hardly a part of
the church without its special meaning: 'even the smallest
details should have a meaning, or serve a purpose<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>,' and
whatever has a meaning serves a purpose, and whatever serves
a purpose, has a meaning, and a very important one too.
The four main walls of the building have a similar meaning
to the pillars. They are supposed to represent the four
Evangelists<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. The stones of which they are composed represent
Christians&mdash;the living stones of the spiritual building<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 280]  </span>
the cement which joins them together is charity, 'the bond of
perfectness<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>' which binds together the members of the
Christian Church. The door<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> represents the means of entrance
to the invisible kingdom; the windows remind us of that sacred
presence which keeps out the storm of angry and sinful life,
and admits the light of Christ and His Word. You see,
Matthew, the old church builders were themselves <i>Churchmen</i>;
sometimes even bishops were famous architects, like Gundulph,
Bishop of Rochester, and William of Wykeham, Bishop of
Winchester; and then they made themselves felt in all their
works&mdash;I mean, they gave a religious character and meaning to
all parts of the structure they reared. And so there were
always a hundred preachers in the Church, though not a
tongue uttered a single word."</p>

<p>"I understand what you mean, sir&mdash;the stones were the
preachers."</p>

<p>"Just so, Matthew; and then the churches were always open,
and people used to go and meditate and pray there at all hours;
for in church they found themselves surrounded by so much
that reminded them of Heaven and God's presence, and sacred
things, and so little to remind them of the world and of sin,
that they could think and pray there better than any where else.
But in after times the old churches became neglected and
dilapidated, and the new churches were so mean and cold and
bare, that there was every thing to chill and nothing to warm
devotion, and so people gave up the good old custom of going
to hear the stones preach, and to say their daily prayers to God
in His sanctuary. But the time is coming back again, I am
thankful to say, and church builders are again good Churchmen,
and regard the building of churches as a sacred art and a
religious work; and the people are less contented to be ignorant
about these things; and the churches are no longer closed from
Sunday night to the next Sunday morning, as they used to be."</p>

<p>"I haven't read my Bible right, Mr. Ambrose, if it isn't a
very wicked thing to allow God's House to go to decay. In
our old church people seemed to have forgotten all about the
'<i>beauty</i> of holiness,' both in their manner of worship and in
the house where they worshipped. They had their own houses<span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]  </span>
'ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion,' and this house
was 'laid waste<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.' I have been told how grand Queen
Victoria's Palace is, and how beautiful the Parliament House
is, and I have often thought that surely, sir, the house of the
great King of kings, and the great Ruler of all our rulers
should be grand and beautiful too. But our churchwardens
not only didn't try to make the old church beautiful, sir, but
hid as much as possible of whatever beauty they found."</p>

<p>"Too true, my friend," said the Vicar: "these old pillars
had become so coated over with whitewash that their rich
carved work could hardly be seen at all. Whitewash was the
cheapest thing they could use to hide the green damp and the
plaster patches, and for that reason I suppose they used it."</p>

<p>The work of decoration went on rapidly; the many busy
hands soon effected a wonderful change in the appearance of
the church, which gave it a very festive character. The
choicest flowers were placed at the back of the altar, others
were used in various ecclesiastical designs, or woven into
wreaths of evergreens. The texts of Holy Scripture painted
above the arches from pillar to pillar were neatly framed in
borders of evergreens, and wreaths of the same were already
twined around many of the columns<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>The capitals of all the pillars were carved in imitation of the
many wild flowers and ferns which grew in the neighbourhood<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>.
Although these had been carved not less than five hundred
years ago, the same wild flowers were still to be found in the
parish; and every year on Ascension Day it was the custom at
St. Catherine's to decorate each of these pillars with the same
natural flowers that had been imitated in stone. It was a
pretty custom, for as the natural leaves and flowers faded or
were removed, their more enduring likenesses were disclosed,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]  </span>
and remained throughout the year the faithful representatives
of their bright and gay originals.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said the Vicar, addressing Ellen Walton,
his churchwarden's little daughter, "you have really shown
great taste in arranging those ferns; they look beautiful
indeed."</p>

<p>"I deserve but little credit, sir, for any taste of my own,"
she replied, "for I have but copied the stone carving as near
as I could."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you <i>do</i> deserve great credit, as every body does
who copies exactly that which is worth copying. The workman
who so cleverly imitated in stone these beautiful works of God,
in order to adorn God's House throughout the year with
memorials of His goodness in making our summer fields so
lovely, deserved much praise; and now, though yours is a
lighter task, that you have given life, as it were, to his work,
by your nice arrangement of leaf to leaf, and flower to flower,
I must give you some praise too. But I see you are anxious
to ask me a question."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I was talking to Sally Strike this morning about
the decorations, and she says they are all nonsense and unmeaning;
she says, too, it's very wicked to put flowers about
the church, for it's nothing but a heathen and idolatrous
custom. Of course, I don't much notice what she says about
it, but I don't very well know what to answer her, and I was
going to ask you, sir, to be kind enough to tell me."</p>

<p>"Sally Strike doesn't often say any thing very wise, my dear,
and this is no exception to the rule. You had better answer
her out of her own mouth. Ask her, when she gathered all
the flowers her own garden could produce to decorate the little
'Rehoboth'&mdash;as they call that meeting-house on Wanderer's
Heath&mdash;when they held their last 'love feast,' and had tea and
cake in their chapel, did she put the flowers there to make the
place look gloomy, or to make it look festive and gay? Or,
why did she do the same thing a little while ago, when they
gave a children's treat in their meeting-house? Was it
because it was a time of sadness or of rejoicing? No doubt,
she will tell you it was the latter. Well, we decorate our
churches for a similar reason. We regard all the Christian<span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]  </span>
festivals as seasons for great gladness and rejoicing, and whilst
at other times we are obliged, for the most part, to content
ourselves with such ornamentation of God's House as our
own poor imitations of the forms and colours of Nature can
supply, on these high days we press into the service of the
temple the lovely originals of all those forms and colours,
fresh and pure as when they first left the hand of their Divine
Maker.</p>

<p>"'Tis true that the heathen used flowers in decorating their
temples and altars, and also their victims prepared for sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.
But they used them just as Sally Strike uses them at her meeting-house,
for the <i>sole</i> purpose of <i>decoration</i>. Now, though we use
flowers to give a festive appearance to our churches, our use of
them has, too, always a meaning beyond that: how they remind
us of the <i>love of God</i> in arraying this earth with so much beauty
for our enjoyment; how they remind us of the pure and
lovely delights of the Paradise that is lost; and of our future
resurrection<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> to a Paradise of yet greater beauty. And it is from
our Bibles that we learn to give, too, an <i>emblematic</i> meaning to
particular flowers, so that, whether carved by man, or moulded
by the hand of Nature, each one teaches its own useful lesson.
There we find the lily mentioned as the emblem of God's
providence; the rose as the type of youthful beauty; the cedar,
of manly strength. Nay, my dear Ellen, we may even find in
Holy Scripture itself our authority for decorating our churches
with these pure and unsinning works of God. You remember,
no doubt, the verse to which I allude: 'The glory of Lebanon
shall come unto thee: the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box
together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>'."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, I quite understand your explanation. But
Sally Strike said she didn't object to the way the church used
to be decorated thirty years ago, when plain twigs of evergreen
were put at the corners of the pews, and some large branches fixed
here and there on the walls; but she does not like the triangles
and circles and crosses, and the other designs we now use."</p>

<p>"And yet nothing could be more silly than the dislike,
though I fear it is one in which many&mdash;for mere want of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]  </span>
thought&mdash;share. Surely, the twigs themselves must be at least
as harmless when bound together as when used singly; and
certainly it is better that they should be formed into beautiful
and religiously <i>suggestive</i> designs, than scattered unmeaningly
about the church. The cross, often repeated, reminds us, you
know, of the one grand pervading truth of our religion; the
circle, of eternity; the triangle, of the Holy Trinity. We
almost even forget the beauty of the design itself in the beauty
of its symbol.</p>

<h2>THE ROOF</h2><span class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</span>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">"I</span>'m glad to see you both among the helpers to-day," said
the Vicar, as he shook hands with William Hardy and
Richard Atkinson, "though I know this must cost you at least
the value of a day's work."</p>

<p>The village carpenter and mason were always accustomed on
these occasions to give their services gratuitously.</p>

<p>"Very glad indeed to come and do the best we can, sir,"
replied William Hardy, "though we couldn't quite agree about
it at home, my wife and me, till we'd talked it over a bit."</p>

<p>Now Hardy's wife, though not generally unamiable, was
like many other wives in this respect; namely, she had
acquired a habit of always questioning the wisdom or sincerity
of her husband's actions, which she could now no more shake
off than she could her own identity.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," said the Vicar; "but how
was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir, my wife says to me, 'William, you
might turn your time to better account than going up to the
church with Richard Atkinson to-day. You'd be able to earn
five shillings, and that would just pay for the new ribbon for
my bonnet, which indeed I do want very much.' 'I really
believe you do, my dear,' says I, 'and so I must just alter my
plans a little. I thought I wanted a new Sunday hat very
much indeed, and I was just going to buy one at Master
Dole's the other day, when thinks I to myself&mdash;no, I mustn't
buy it, because I shall lose a day's earnings at church next
week, so I'll give the new hat to the church, and have one for
myself six months hence. But that's no reason why you
should lose your ribbons, so I'll over-work for a few days, and
earn the ribbons that way.' You see, Mr. Ambrose, I was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]  </span>
thinking of that text, 'God forbid that I should offer to the
Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing.' Well, sir,
them words softened her a good deal; but then she says to
me, 'William, what's the <i>use</i> of all them ornaments at the
church? I really do call it waste of time and money.' 'My
dear,' says I, 'there's something better than <i>use</i>, I mean as you
and I talk of use, there is such a thing as doing things out of
love and reverence for God, and for nothing else, and that's
what I should like to do if I can. There wasn't no more <i>use</i> in
the precious ointment which the good woman poured on our
Saviour's head, than in these ornaments we put up in His
church. And you know who it was that called that a <i>waste</i>,
and you know who it was too that praised her for what she
did<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.' 'I think you're right,' says she; and so I came away."</p>

<p>"And so you were, my friend. But it's hard to persuade
people that there is such a thing as <i>a worship of adoration</i>,
prompted simply by a sense of love, gratitude, veneration,
entirely apart from all idea of benefit, advantage, or use to
ourselves in <i>any way</i>. As you rightly say, however, <i>there is</i>.&mdash;But
I see the children have finished the frames for the
clerestory<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> windows, so you had better put them up."</p>

<p>"You mean the windows just under the roof, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is not safe for them to climb so high."</p>

<p>"I suppose you won't attempt to carry your decorations
higher than that, Mr. Vicar?" said the Squire, as he approached
to see how the work was going on.</p>

<p>"No, that must satisfy us. Indeed, this roof is so rich in
colour and carving that we could hardly make it look more
festive than it does."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, a grand old roof; but I rather prefer the high-pitched
roof of the chancel to this flatter one of the nave,
though certainly nothing can be more beautiful than its
carving. The figures of angels on the corbels<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> supporting the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]  </span>
principal timbers are exceedingly well done. What do you
imagine to be the dates of these two roofs?"</p>

<p>"I should say that that in the chancel was built about
A.D. 1350, and this in the nave about A.D. 1500. These flatter
roofs of our perpendicular period do not any of them date
much farther back than A.D. 1500<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you in preferring the older high-pitch
for our timber roofs. By-the-bye, it is a curious conception
that this particular kind of roof has a likeness to the inverted
keel of the ark<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>&mdash;itself an emblem of the Christian Church.
But I prefer to regard it, as I do the windows, and doors, and
arches of <i>pointed</i> architecture, as an emblem of the <i>incompleteness</i>
of our worship here. As I look up through the intricate
multitude of timbers, and my gaze becomes lost amid the dark
top beams of the roof, my thoughts are insensibly led higher
still<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. There is something in these lofty open roofs that
always seems to invite one's thoughts <i>above them</i>&mdash;so different
from the flat ceilings of most dissenting meeting-houses, and
some of our churches built a hundred years ago. To me these
flat ceilings are very depressing."</p>

<p>"Yes; and not a little irritating too, when you consider what<span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]  </span>
splendid timber roofs in old churches, they often conceal.
Ugly, however, and objectionable as they are, they have the one
merit of being <i>unpretending</i>; and give me any thing rather than
a <i>sham</i>&mdash;a lath-and-plaster roof with papier-maché or stucco
bosses, and all sorts of painting and shading in perspective,
in imitation of wood or stone, making the poor roof guilty of
a perpetual <i>lie</i>. I do own that tries my temper immensely!"</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt, too, that the high-pitch better
suits our variable climate than any other. I fear, however,
that many of those which were built but a few years since are
not very enduring. Young, or badly-seasoned wood, thin, poor
timbers, which cannot last long, have too often been put into
the roof. Sometimes this has been the dishonest act of the
builder; but we have been too much in the habit of building
for <i>ourselves only</i>&mdash;not like our forefathers, who put up those
big masses of timber over our heads. They built for themselves
and for <i>posterity too</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'They dreamt not of a perishable home,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Who thus could build<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.'"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ah, yes! and that is, of course, especially true of those
who erected the noble <i>stone</i> roofs of our cathedrals, and many
parish churches too. Nothing, of course, can equal the stone
roof with its beautiful carvings and mouldings, richly gilt and
coloured. Nothing like stone for colour! How very beautiful
is the deep blue, with its golden stars, over the altar in our own
cathedral! They look well in our own church, but the colours
are richer there, not so much faded. That representation of
Heaven's canopy mantling over the most holy part of our
church always seems to me so very appropriate and suggestive."</p>

<p>"It is a matter of surprise to me," said the Squire, "that
more care has not generally been taken to beautify the <i>external</i>
part of our church roofs. What relief is given to the long line
of a nave roof by a good patterned row of ridge tiles, or by
some ornamental ironwork on the ridge! The gable cross<span class="pagenum">[Pg 293]  </span>
considerably relieves the chancel roof. And where the roof is
of stone, why don't we have richly-carved <i>external</i>, as well as
internal, stone-work? That, to my mind, is the perfection of a
stone roof<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>."</p>

<p>At this point, the attention of both was directed to little
Harry, old Matthew's grandson, who, with a fixed expression of
deep thoughtfulness, was looking up to wards the roof of the
church.</p>

<p>"Why so very serious just now, my dear boy? What may
your thoughts be about, Harry?" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I was wondering what they used to do with
the roof-gallery, where we've been putting the evergreens?"</p>

<p>"What does he mean by the roof-gallery?" said Mr. Acres.</p>

<p>"Oh, he means the triforium<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>."</p>

<p>"I must confess that is still more unintelligible to me.
Please explain it to me, as well as to Harry, for we are evidently
equally ignorant about it."</p>

<p>"The triforium is the gallery you see just above the arches
of the nave&mdash;between them and the clerestory. It is not commonly
found in parish churches, but I believe all cathedrals
have it. It generally extends nearly all round the building.
There are different opinions as to its original purpose. Some
suppose that it was reserved for the use of women. On the
Continent, it has been set apart for young men, or for strangers.
It is the opinion of some that it was merely built for affording
ready access to the various parts of the roof. As an architectural
feature, it is very effective, and occupies a space which would
otherwise be a blank wall. In this country, however, we know
that it was often used for a similar purpose to that for which
we have now been using it&mdash;the ornamentation of the church
on special festivals, when banners and tapestry and other
ornaments were suspended from the several arches<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>."</p>

<p>"I have often, like little Harry, looked up at those arches
and wondered what they were built for; and, not knowing, I
came to the conclusion that the passage must have been used
for religious processions."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]  </span></p>

<p>"It is not at all improbable that occasionally they were so
used. And I can hardly imagine any thing more solemn than
a torch-light procession of chanting choristers threading their
way round the sacred building, the sound of their voices undulating
in solemn cadence as they would pass the arches of the
triforium, and then dying away amid the groined or timber roof
above them."</p>

<h2>THE TOWER</h2>


<p><SPAN class="dropcap">W</span>hen the Vicar and the Squire met on their way to
church the following day, the conversation of the
previous evening was thus resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will, I am sure, agree with me," said Mr. Ambrose, "in
regarding the church spire as ever teaching <i>outside</i> the building
the same lesson that the open timber roof, as you so truly said
yesterday, is teaching <i>inside</i>. It is always pointing the thoughts
of thoughtful men up above the earthly temple."</p>

<p>"Quite so; and, as is the case with many other great
teachers, the earthly fabric has, I believe, in both these cases, a
very humble origin; for as the grandest cathedral roof is but a
development of the simple <i>tent</i> which formed the early habitation
of the once rude inhabitants of this and other countries,
so has its lofty and elegant spire gradually raised itself from the
low and unpretending roof which covered in the towers of our
earliest parish churches.</p>

<p>"I am inclined myself to think that, as a matter of taste
and beauty, no church tower is complete without a spire in
some form<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>, and it is a question whether, in every case, the
tower was not at first built with a view to such an ornament.
The termination with a flat or only embattled cornice does
not harmonize well with pointed architecture; the spiral form
seems to me the only appropriate termination; and, as you
say, the symbolic teaching of this part of the building depends
upon it. And yet, though it may almost seem a contradiction
to what I have said, the spire always needs some object for the
eye to rest upon at its summit. The time-honoured <i>weather-cock</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]  </span>
which every body knows to be the emblem of <i>watchfulness</i>,
seems by far the most convenient and suitable, though I
am aware that other forms&mdash;such as a dragon, and a boat&mdash;are
fixed to the summits of some spires."</p>

<p>"We do not generally succeed well," said Mr. Ambrose, "in
our imitations of the Norman style of architecture. Its extreme
massiveness, on which so much of its beauty depends, renders
it very costly; and if this is abandoned, as it often is, for the
sake of saving expense, and only the details of the style are
copied, whilst the walls are thin and unsubstantial, the building
has always a mean and cardboard appearance. But where the
style is faithfully carried out, it is a matter of surprise to me
that the <i>round</i> tower is not more often adopted. It harmonizes
so well with the semi-circular arches and the apsidal
termination of the chancel. We have, you know, many
splendid examples of such towers<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. It is true, indeed, that the
architects may in some cases have adopted this form, in places
where there was difficulty in obtaining the stone required for
the corners of a square tower, as being the most convenient
for a building composed of flint only; but that they did not
always choose this form as a mere matter of convenience, and
not for its own peculiar beauty, is evident from the fact that in
the construction of some round towers not only flint, but also
stone, is largely employed. The objection to these towers,
founded on the supposition that they are not adapted for the
use of bells, may, I think, be easily met by a little constructional
arrangement of the interior of the belfry."</p>

<p>"The erection of towers <i>detached</i> from the church has not, I
am glad to say, gained much favour in this country<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. They
certainly lose much of their beauty when separated from the
main building. The custom, however, greatly prevails in
Italy. The appropriation of a portion of the tower as a priest's
chamber is, I believe, far more common with us than it is
abroad<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]  </span></p>

<p>At this moment the bells of St. Catherine's commenced a
cheerful peal.</p>

<p>"After all," said the Vicar, "<i>that sound</i> indicates the real
purpose of the tower."</p>

<p>"True enough," answered Mr. Acres; "no doubt our towers
were built to hold the <i>bells</i><a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>; and so, if the tower is good and
sound, and the bells are there, we must not complain if the
spire is wanting."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I wish the bells were under better control than
they commonly are."</p>

<p>"Ah, so indeed do I. There's no part of the church so
much desecrated as the tower. Now, I grieve for this; for to
my mind there's no music so delightful as that of the church
bells, provided there is nothing in the occasion of their being
rung which grates upon one's feelings. I often think of the
story of a savage people who had never seen a church bell
before, when for the first time they heard it ringing, they
believed that it was <i>talking</i> to them<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. There is certainly no
music that <i>speaks</i> to us like that of the church bells. What
call is there more eloquent than the chimes 'going for
church'? What voice more reproachful than theirs to one who
disobeys their summons? What sound so solemn as the deep-toned
knell? What so happy as the marriage peal? Ah, my<span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]  </span>
dear friend, you and I know full well what joys and sorrows,
what hopes and fears, the dear old church bells can tell of.
How the old memories of half-forgotten home-scenes come
back to us when we listen to their merry Christmas ringing!
Nothing like them to fill the arm-chairs that have so long stood
empty, to tenant the old places with the once familiar forms
which have long gone from us! Nothing like them to bring back
the dear old voices and the dear old faces; nothing like them
to put back the old furniture in its old places again; nothing
like them to revive the bright and happy hours that are past!
Then, somehow, the bells always seem to adapt their voices to
each particular season. What joyful hope there was in their
music at Easter! a still gladder song they sing to-day. They
seem to me to have their own peculiar utterance for Sunday and
for saints' day, for fast and for festival. What a joyful song of
thanksgiving they sang at our harvest festival last year! I shall
never forget what the bells said to me on that day.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me, my dear Vicar, for intruding this
long rhapsody into our conversation, my fondness for the
music of church bells is so intense, that I fear you will consider
the expression of my admiration to be quite childish. I
don't mean to say they always make me feel cheerful and
happy. Oh, no, they don't do that; but most commonly they
induce a sort of pleasant melancholy&mdash;harmless, and even good
in moderation, but morbid in excess. These simple lines
exactly express what I often feel when the bells are ringing:&mdash;</p>

</div><br>

<p>"I know the feeling well," said Mr. Ambrose; "we love the
<i>silent eloquence</i> of each feature of the church's fabric as we love<span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>
the vivid expression of each feature of a dear friend, and we
love&mdash;as we love his familiar voice&mdash;the well-known <i>uttered
language</i> of the old church tower."</p>

<p>"Yes; and not more discordant would be the merry voice of
a friend, with a heart bowed down with sorrow, than seems to
me a merry peal of the church bells, with the penitential
seasons of the Christian year. I greatly admire your custom
of only ringing three bells during Lent and Advent, and tolling
a single bell on Good Friday. The contrast to the usual
joyful chimes cannot fail to strike every one."</p>

<p>"I am most thankful that in our parish we have a set of
bellringers who really feel a proper interest in the work, and
regard theirs as a <i>religious</i> office. I have only allowed men of
well-known steady habits and good moral character to be among
them. From the time I came here, as you know, I have been
their president, and have always attended their annual dinners.
Then their <i>rules</i><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> are good. No drinking is allowed in the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]  </span>
belfry, no one is allowed to wear his hat there, and no loud
and boisterous language is permitted: any one using offensive
words or swearing is at once expelled. In fact, I think we do
all that can be done to teach the ringers that they are engaged
in a religious duty, in a part of <i>God's house</i>. I am fully sensible
that much of our success is due to your influence among
them, and I very much wish that more Church laymen in your
position would follow your example, and take part in the
<i>actual ringing</i> of the church bells<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. On one occasion, long ago,
I had some difficulty with our ringers. You remember old Sir
Perrygal Biber? a greater profligate or drunkard perhaps never
lived. He had wit enough, however, to secure his election for
the county, and money enough to reward those who voted for
him. I am sorry to say that in many parishes the church bells,
which had once been solemnly dedicated to God's service, were
impressed to do honour to that man, whose immorality was
patent to the whole county. Our ringers naturally thought that
what was not wrong elsewhere would not be wrong here, and
so begged permission to follow the example of their neighbours.
However, they were good fellows, and open to reason.
I explained to them first that our church bells had nothing
whatever to do with mere secular matters, such as the election
of a member of Parliament; and then I showed them that
their neighbours were specially wrong in this instance, because<span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]  </span>
they were employing what was intended for God's service in
doing honour to an impious man. I believe they were all of
them, at heart, glad to get out of it; and, in fact, would never
have thought of ringing at all had not William Strike put it
into their heads. Since then they have not caused me a
moment's trouble.</p>

<p>"The church bells have, alas! often been sadly ill-used;
sometimes broken up and employed for secular purposes<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>;
sometimes sold to pay the cost of repairing the building: but
this, to my mind, is not half so bad as their desecration when
rung on improper occasions."</p>

<p>"No doubt, Mr. Vicar, you have often read with interest the
very quaint legends which are to be found on many church
bells. I very much like the terse Latin sentences, and the oft-repeated
'<i>Jesu, miserere mei</i>,' we meet with on the oldest of
them. Not a few, too, of the more modern bells have simple
pious inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. But there are some, both ancient and
modern, that have foolish or otherwise objectionable sentences
upon them<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. In some cases they are merely laudatory of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]  </span>
the donor; in others of the founder, or of the churchwardens
of the parish. I should think, however, that there is scarcely
a peal of bells in the country, except, perhaps, a few very recently
cast, but possesses some both interesting and instructive
inscriptions. Of course, many volumes would be filled with
them, could they be all collected. I once copied one of these
legends which much pleased me, but I cannot now call to
mind where I found it. Let me repeat it to you.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Men's death I tell by doleful knell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lightning and thunder I break asunder,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On Sabbath all to church I call,<br></span>

<span class="i0">The winds so fierce I do disperse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Men's cruel rage I do assuage.'"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It was a curious conceit, which I suppose every body once
accepted, that the ringing of the church bells cleared the air of
all evil and discordant spirits, and caused the storm and the
tempest to cease. But the Church had another and a better
reason for ordering the bells to be rung at such times; and
that was, 'that the faithful might be admonished to be urgent
in prayer for the instant danger<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.' I like the idea of the
Church bell inviting to <i>private prayer</i> as well as public
worship, but we have almost lost it. The <i>passing bell</i> used to
ask the private prayers of the faithful in behalf of the spirit
passing from earth. This was truly a Christian custom; nevertheless,
I see difficulties in the way of its general revival."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have not, however, lost sight, my dear friend, of the
invitation to <i>private</i> devotion as associated with church bells;
for it is in this light I regard the ringing of the little sancte
bell just before the consecration of the elements at the celebration<span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]  </span>
of Holy Communion. I was very glad when you
restored the old bell to its little turret over the chancel arch;
and I know that when it is rung, many who cannot come to
church bend their knees and join heartily with us in our
prayers and adoration."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a good old practice of the early Church, and I
am very glad to know that its revival has been a blessing and
a comfort to many by awakening solemn thought and earnest
prayer."</p>

hear he is not quite so well," said the Vicar, as he
parted from his companion, and entered the little door that
led up to the old sexton's chamber.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said the Vicar, taking the old man's
trembling hand, "I see you are still very weak; but I trust
you are not suffering much?"</p>

<p>"Weak, very, sir; but, thank God, no pain. I feel, however,
that the end can't be very far off. You must look out
for another sexton, sir, for old Matthew's work is nearly over."</p>

<p>"<i>His</i> will be done," said the Vicar; and the old man
breathed a solemn "Amen," which seemed spoken for no
earthly ears.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," at length said Matthew, "that it's
ten years since you and I, sir, and Mr. Acres, met at the old
lych gate in that terrible storm. I remember I said then that
it wouldn't be long before some younger ones would have to
carry me through the gate, but God has spared me these ten
years more, and now I shall need none to bear me through
the gate; for here I am&mdash;thanks to your kindness, sir&mdash;already
within the gate, and even within the House of God itself."</p>

<p>"Yes; and so when God calls you to Himself, He will but
take you from one temple to another&mdash;from the courts of His
House here, to live for ever in His heavenly mansions.
'Those that be planted in the House of the Lord shall flourish
in the courts of our God<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.'"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I should like to be buried beside little
Lizzie Daniels. 'Tis long ago now since I made that little grave,
and I fear the flower-bed is a good deal overgrown with grass,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span>
for I have been too poorly to look after it as I used to; but I
think you'll know it, sir. She helped in her own quiet, simple
way to teach an old man the way to Heaven; and I have never
forgotten her lessons. How often she used to talk about this
day&mdash;Ascension Day! She once said to me, sir, that you had
told her we ought to remember this day throughout the year,
and to try and lead an <i>Ascension</i> life, and let our thoughts and
desires dwell as much as possible where our Saviour has gone
before. I have tried to do so&mdash;God forgive me, for I have
often failed!"</p>

<p>He then drew the Vicar nearer to him, and whispered in his
ear, "Be good to dear little Harry, sir, when I'm gone. He
loves me so, I fear 'twill break his heart."</p>

<p>The "parson's bell," as it was called, was now ringing, so
the Vicar, having promised that his wishes should be fully
carried out, was compelled to hasten into the church. He
first laid his hand on the noble brow of the good old man,
and pronounced the blessing of Heaven upon him, and then
bade him farewell, adding, "I hope, my dear friend, we may
be permitted to meet again in this earthly house of God; but
if not, my heart-deep hope and prayer is, that we may meet in
His house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>."</p>

<p>The little window that looked into the church from the
sexton's chamber was opened, and none listened more earnestly
to the festive service, and to the Vicar's sermon, on that
Ascension Day than did old Matthew Hutchinson.</p>

<p>Although it was a common practice with the Vicar on
festivals not to preach from any particular passage of Holy
Scripture, but simply to make the festival itself the subject of his
discourse, yet on this occasion he selected these words as his
text: "The patterns of things in the heavens<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>." He showed
how that all this world of ours, in which so much that is beautiful
and lovely has survived the fall, is full of patterns, or
symbols, or types of things in that Heaven to which Christ has
ascended; how that the whole Bible abounds with the most
vivid symbolism and the most graphic imagery representative
of the glories of that Heavenly kingdom; and then, looking
round the beautiful church, now so richly adorned with its<span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>
festive decorations, he explained how the earthly building, in its
several parts, possessed a thousand patterns of those heavenly
things which make up the spiritual fabric of the Church of Christ.
"When we regard the material fabric of the Christian Church,"
he said, "as a type of the spiritual house, ever rising higher and
higher in honour of its Divine Founder, of which the saints on
earth and the saints in Heaven are the living stones, we are
arraying the noblest work of man with its grandest and most
exalted dignity. 'Ye are built upon the <i>foundations</i> of the
Apostles and Prophets,' writes St. Paul to the Church of
Ephesus, 'Jesus Christ Himself being the chief <i>corner stone</i>; in
whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
holy <i>temple</i> in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together
for an habitation of God through the Spirit<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>.' Here, in the
symbol of the <i>foundation stones</i> of the material structure, we have
represented to us, as it were, at one view, all those heavenly
graces and blessings which from the day of Pentecost down to
this time have flowed to God's people through the visible
ministry and appointed ordinances of the Christian Church.
Then, under the figure of the <i>corner stone</i>&mdash;the key stone of the
edifice&mdash;we have gathered up all those old prophecies and types
which pointed on forward, through the sufferings and death of
the Saviour, up to the time when, having established His
Church in the world, He should be Himself the heavenly life
of its living members. Long had it been 'contained in the
Scriptures: Behold, I lay in Zion a chief <i>corner stone</i>, elect,
precious; and he that believeth on Him shall not be confounded<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>,'
and in the fulness of time 'the stone which the
builders refused became the <i>head stone of the corner</i><a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>.'</p>

<p>"And next see, my friends, how the figure is carried out
by the two Apostles, St. Paul and St. Peter, so as to embrace
all the faithful members of Christ's Church. They are represented
by St. Paul as 'the whole <i>building fitly framed together</i><a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>,'
and by St. Peter, as the living stones which compose this living
temple&mdash;'Ye also as <i>lively stones</i> are built up a <i>spiritual
house</i><a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.' And this figure of a living temple is thus constantly<span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]  </span>
employed by the sacred writers: 'Know ye not that your
bodies are the <i>Temple of God</i>?' writes St. Paul to the Corinthian
Church; and, again, 'Ye are the <i>Temple of the living God</i><a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.'
St. Jude is following out the same idea when he exhorts
Christians to <i>build up themselves in their most holy faith</i>."</p>

<p>The Vicar ended his sermon with an earnest, practical
application of the subject. "Let me entreat you, my dear
friends, often to suffer the solemn thoughts which this sacred
symbol suggests to dwell on your minds: '<i>The temple of the
Lord</i> is holy, which temple <i>ye are</i>.' Holy Prophets and Holy
Apostles, and confessors, and martyrs, are the foundation of
the sacred building; the Holy Jesus is the corner stone, in
whom ye&mdash;the living stones&mdash;must be <i>fitly framed together</i>.
Mark, my friends, there must be <i>no schism, no division, no rent
or fissure</i>, that ye may be a spiritual house perfect in all its
parts, and pure in all its adornments. Oh, then, cherish that
heavenly life within you, which alone can keep the building
compact and firm! Be fruitful in good works. Remember
faith without works is not living, but <i>dead</i><a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. 'Put on charity,
which is the <i>bond of perfectness</i><a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>,' and will be the best evidence
to God and man, and to your own souls, that you possess a
living faith; that you are, indeed, <i>living stones in a living temple</i>.
Be sure the cement that must unite the living stones of the
spiritual house is brotherly love and fervent charity. Without
these, the house will be divided against itself; its walls will be
'daubed with untempered mortar<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>,' and, instead of living
stones, there will be but the dead, outlying blocks of a ruined
house. 'Except the Lord build the house, their labour is but
lost that build it<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.'</p>

<p>"Be it yours, then, 'by patient continuance in <i>well doing</i>, to
seek for glory and immortality<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>' in that 'house eternal in the
heavens, whose Builder and Maker is God.' Learn to see in
the whole earth, and air, and sky&mdash;with their countless beauties
and wondrous harmonies&mdash;reflections of the glories of Heaven,
and promises of the coming bliss of eternity. Learn to read
lessons of wisdom and religion from the many instructive<span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]  </span>
patterns, and symbols, and emblems in nature, and in art,
with which you are ever surrounded. Thus go on, day by day,
advancing nearer to your mansion in Heaven. Thus, in these
earthly temples of Jehovah, be ever purifying your hearts, and
attuning your voices to share in that glorious song of the Lamb
when the sweet music of angels' harps shall vibrate on this
regenerate earth, when her ten thousand choirs shall join with
theirs in joyful harmony&mdash;and melt their united praises in one
never-ending rapture, singing, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come;' 'Blessing and
honour, and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the
Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.'"</p>

<p>In the prayer for the Church militant, which followed the
sermon, the Vicar paused longer than usual when he prayed
God to <i>succour and comfort those who were in sickness</i>. All knew
that he was inviting a special prayer for the old man whom all
the village loved; and had they been offered for the proudest
potentate, the most learned philosopher, or even the greatest
philanthropist that ever lived, the prayers that went up to
Heaven amid that solemn silence for him "for whom the prayers
of the Church were desired," could not have been more fervid
and sincere. When Mr. Ambrose proceeded with the prayer,
a slight stir in the porch chamber was heard by those near at
hand, but it was little noticed.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the service Mr. Acres met the Vicar in
the vestry.</p>

<p>"I should like," said he, "to go with you to see our poor
old friend once more."</p>

<p>"It will probably be the last time," replied the Vicar, "for
he was evidently sinking when I saw him before service. I
told little Harry to go up to him as soon as we had sung the
last hymn."</p>

<p>Both went up together. The Vicar was not mistaken.
Calm and peaceful, without a line of care or pain, there lay
the placid face, and the eyes were closed in the last, long
sleep. One hand lay motionless upon the bed, grasped by his
little grandson, who was kneeling beside him, still robed in the
snow-white surplice with which he had recently left the choir.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]  </span></p>

<p>"Poor little fellow!" said the Vicar; "I will keep my
promise to the old man. He shall not be left without a
friend, though his best is gone."</p>

<p>But Mr. Acres saw that the little hands were white as the
aged hand they clasped.</p>

<p>"He's with a better Friend now, my dear Vicar," said he,
"than this earth can give him. We shall hear his sweet voice
no more in our choir here; he has gone to join the choir of
angels in a nobler temple than ours."</p>

<p>Old Matthew's words were true; the loving little heart was
broken. The old oak had fallen, and crushed the tender
sapling as it fell<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>. On the morning of Trinity Sunday, there
stood under the old yew-tree of St. Catherine's churchyard,
three little stone crosses side-by-side, where but one had been
before.</p>

The erection of these masses of stone without restraint would make
our churchyards only the burial-places of the rich, and would soon entirely
exclude the poor from a place in them; whereas the poor have an equal
claim with the rich to be buried there, and when buried, the same title to
respect and protection.</p></div>

churchyards, unless they have reference to the heathen custom of burning
the dead, and placing the ashes in funeral urns, can have no meaning at all.
We moreover not unfrequently see a gilded flame issuing from these urns,
and here of course the reference is most clearly marked. The Christian
custom of burying the dead, which we practise in imitation of the entombment
of Christ, dates from the earliest history of man; and as well from the
Old as the New Testament we learn that it has ever been followed by those
who professed to obey the Divine will. The first grave of which we have
any account was the grave of Sarah, Abraham's wife (Gen. xxiii. 19), and
the first grave-stone was that over the burial-place of Rachel, Jacob's wife
(Gen. xlix. 31).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> There are comparatively but few churchyard grave-stones more than
250 years old, and probably there are very few of an earlier date but have
engraved upon them the sign of the Cross. There are two very ancient
grave-stones of this character, having also heads carved upon them, in the
churchyard of Silchester. It is likely that the old churchyard crosses were
often mortuary memorials. Probably there is hardly an old churchyard
but has, at some time, been adorned with its churchyard cross; in most
cases, some remains of this most appropriate and beautiful ornament still
exist, and doubtless is often older than the churchyard as a place of Christian
burial. In many places this cross has been lately restored to its proper
place, near to the Lich-Gate. "Let a handsome churchyard cross be erected
in every churchyard."&mdash;Institutions of the Bishop of Winchester, A.D. 1229.</p></div>

graves, is in every respect preferable to that which we see practised in
Continental burial-grounds, where the graves are often covered with
immortelles, vases of gaudy artificial flowers, images, &amp;c. We have seen
as many as fifty wreaths of artificial flowers and tinselled paper, in every
stage of decomposition, over one grave in the cemetery of Père la Chaise,

the graves with fresh flowers on Easter Day.</p></div>

of their churches as beautiful as possible. During some periods, especially
the Norman, they seem to have bestowed more labour upon them than upon
any other portion of the building. Both externally and internally they were
richly decorated, and often abounded in emblematic tracery.</p></div>

It is more common in early English than in Norman architecture, and very
frequently to be found in churches of the Decorated and Perpendicular
periods. Probably the largest parvise in England is at Bishop's-Cleeve,
near Cheltenham. There are interesting specimens at Bridport, Bishop's
Auckland, Ampthill, Finedon, Cirencester, Grantham, Martley, Fotheringay,
Sherborne, St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, Stanwick, Outwell, and St. Peter's-in-the-East,
Oxford. In a few instances there are two parvises, one over
the north and one over the south porch, as at Wellingborough. In some
cases, as at Martley, Worcestershire, the upper moulding of the original
Norman doorway has been concealed by the parvise of later architecture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The room may have been the residence of one or more of the ordinary
priests of the church, or perhaps only a <i>study</i> for them (see previous note),
or it may have been occupied by an anchorite or hermit, or by a chantry
priest. Rooms for these several purposes are also not unfrequently to be
found over the vestry, as at Cropredy, near Banbury, and at Staindrop,
Durham.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Fire-places are of frequent occurrence in these chambers; many of them

St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, the room over the grand north porch, in which
are the remains of the chests in which Chatterton professed to find the
manuscripts attributed to Rowley, was at one time known as the <i>treasury
house</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> "The chamber over the porch was generally used for the keeping of
books and records belonging to the church. Such an appendage was added
to many churches in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; and some of
these old libraries still remain with their books fastened to shelves or desks
by small chains."&mdash;<i>Brandon's Gothic Architecture.</i>
</p><p>
Over the porch at Finedon (of which we give an engraving) is a parvise
in which is contained a valuable library of about 1000 volumes, placed there
by Sir John English Dolben, Bart., A.D. 1788. At St. Peter's-in-the-East,
Oxford, and many other places, are similar libraries.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> These were probably small chantries. It is comparatively seldom that

chantries were suppressed, the children were promoted from the porch to
the parvise.</p></div>

having two Norman window-openings, unglazed, and a straight-gabled
niche between them on the outside. In former days this chamber was constantly
inhabited by one of the sextons, who acted as a watchman, but since
the restoration of the church it has been disused."&mdash;<i>Harston's Handbook of
Sherborne Abbey.</i>
</p><p>
In the church accounts of St. Peter's-in-the-East, Oxford, A.D. 1488, there
is a charge for a "key to clerk's chamber." This no doubt referred to the
parvise.</p></div>

find this window directed obliquely to wards the altar, as is commonly the

The colour is exceedingly rich and well preserved. The painting measures
4 ft. 6 in. by 4 ft., and is supposed to be of the thirteenth century. It represents
the Last Judgment. Our Lord is sitting on His Throne, showing the
five wounds. On the right hand is an angel showing the Cross, on the left an
angel with a spear. Four nails are represented near the head of our Lord.
In the lower part of the painting are two angels holding trumpets, and below
them three persons rising out of the tomb.

It is probable that the interior of almost every old church in the country has
at some time been decorated with wall-paintings&mdash;very many of them have
been brought to light in recent works of church restoration. The favourite
subjects were representations of Heaven and Hell, and of the Day
of Judgment. In many cathedrals and some parish churches the <i>Dance
of Death</i> was painted on the walls. This was one of the most popular
religious plays about four centuries ago.</p></div>

are far older than the churches themselves. And it is more than probable
that in many instances they mark the places where heathen rites were once
celebrated. It was natural for our Christian forefathers to select these spots
as places of worship, since, being held sacred by the heathen people around
them, they would be regarded by them with reverence and respect, and thus
the cross which they reared, and the dead which they buried beneath the wide-spreading
branches of these old trees would be preserved from desecration.</p></div>

the literal meaning. Also, by the windows the senses of the body
are signified: which ought to be shut to the vanities of this world, and open
to receive with all freedom spiritual gifts. By the lattice-work of the
windows, we understand the Prophets or other obscure teachers of the

vellum used in the windows of their monasteries, and that afterwards, on
the introduction of glass, their vellum illuminations suggested their glass
painting.</p></div>

of Stoke Dabernoun, Surrey; Odell, Bedfordshire; St. John's, Bristol;

year by year absorbed in the payment of the debt then incurred. One evidence

in churches was intended to be other than temporary. At the

a reason for the order, which no longer exists. One of many churches
in which the Commandments were painted at an early date over the chancel
arch, is Fordwich, Kent; the date is 1688. At Dimchurch, in Kent, there

and the box is formed of a single block of wood strongly bound with iron
hoops. Sometimes, however, they are richly carved, as in the churches of
Clymping, Sussex; Luton, Bedfordshire; and Faversham, Kent. The
proper place for the parish chest is the vestry, but it is not unfrequently to
be found in some other part of the church. We often meet with several
large chests of common deal in various parts of the church containing
useless papers and other rubbish. The sooner these are swept away the

It is curious to note how the word obtains its present use in architecture.
After the destruction of the city of Caryæ in Arcadia by the Greeks,
Praxiteles, and other Athenian artists, employed female figures, instead of
columns, in architecture, to commemorate the disgrace of the Caryatides,
or women of Caryæ (see Dr. Smith's Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities,
<i>Caryatis</i>). These figures were always represented with corbels or baskets on
their heads. The basket, being thus placed between the head of the figure
and the roof, was that which <i>immediately</i> supported the roof. Hence those
projecting pieces of stone or wood which support the roofs of our churches,
as well as other buildings, have received the name of corbels. <i>Caryatides</i>
may be seen on the north and south sides of New St. Pancras Church,
London&mdash;a church which externally possesses all the appearances of a
heathen temple, and few of a Christian church.</p></div>

elegance and beauty with those of an earlier date, yet, for the abundance of
rich and elaborate detail in wood-carving (oak and walnut), no period
equalled this. The bench-ends, screens, rood-screens, tombs of wood at
this time were exquisitely beautiful. The roofs, however, were too flat, and
externally they were concealed altogether by parapets.</p></div>

some years ago, at St. Bride's, Monmouthshire, there being no ladder in
the village long enough to reach the top of the tower, <i>the tower was lowered
to meet the length of the ladder</i>.</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
